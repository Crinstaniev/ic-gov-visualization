Elect/Bless new replica binary revision (commit f2fc23733b52c53c8f1cfc05eba508c05e87c8b1)

Changelog:
* Boundary nodes: TLS cert update fixes
* Boundary nodes: Cache query calls in nginx
* Consensus: Update consensus ECDSA payload types
* Consensus: Fix problems when a node is joining a busy subnet
* Crypto: Implement TLS client handshake using rustls
* Crypto: Improve client and server certificate verification
* Crypto: Refactor IDKG API
* Crypto: Improve Threshold Signature benchmarks
* Crypto: Initial implementation of MEGa encryption for IDKG
* Crypto: Update zkcrypto/pairing dependencies
* Execution: Introduce per canister heap delta limit to share the heap delta capacity in a fairer manner between canisters.
* Execution: reduce the instruction limit for executing install_code messages on dedicated subnets.  It was initially set to a higher value to support specific use cases but after looking at data from recent install_code requests the value is safe to be lowered to the same value as non dedicated subnets.
* Execution: Adjust cost of various system API calls to better reflect the actual amount of work done in these calls.
* Execution: Use `threadpool::ThreadPool` instead of rayon for query handling.  Rayon shares thread pools underneath the hood which can cause deadlocks.
* Execution: Use the same instruction limit for executing queries as update messages.  Before queries were using a separate constant that had the problem of becoming out of date when the limit for update messages was updated.
* Execution: Reclaim allocated memory on failed message execution.  When a message execution fails, we undo the changes it made, previously we were not adjusting how much memory subsequent executions had available.  This meant that subsequent message executions in the round had less memory available. 
* Execution: Disable the new signal handler on Windows WSL as it is not properly supported.
* Execution: When executing queries on wasm modules which have not yet been compiled to native, prevent multiple compilation processes.
* Messaging: Track memory consumed by in-flight canister messages
* Net: Remove legacy api/v1 HTTP endpoints
* Net: Add rate limiting per connection
* Net: Add buffering, rate limiting and concurrency limit on the ingress ingestion service
* Net: Share the threadpool between query execution and the ingress message filter
* Node: Rework wasm compilation cache
* Node: GuestOS SELinux policy
* Node: Basic CPU profiling with pprof
* P2P: ECDSA message updates, artifact pool improvements
* Various bugfixes and test updates

## Release notes

### Improvements
* Make "upgrade_root" take arguments wrapped in a struct, like all other canister upgrade proposals

### Breaking Changes
* Remove the old, stubbed, method to submit proposals, since these are now (and have been for a while) directly submitted to governance.

Changelog:
This revision includes a fix for a timeout in the `ic-replica` start that we hit with revision `f2fc23733b52c53c8f1cfc05eba508c05e87c8b1` on the app 2 (`qxesv`) subnet during the release process. The fix consists of: 1) reducing the verbosity during the service start, and 2) increasing the timeout. A better fix will be provided in the near future but this should be sufficient to unblock the release rollout.
         Update subnet qxesv-zoxpm-vc64m-zxguk-5sj74-35vrb-tbgwg-pcird-5gr26-62oxl-cae to replica version 3b34266b4c74660a002b2a2ca44d70a56b5865b4

Motivation: This brings the subnet 2 back into the state it was in before the disaster recovery. This will allow us to confirm that a fix resolves the issue.

## Release notes

### New features

* Wait for quiet:

Currently proposals require absolute majority to be adopted, meaning a proposal needs to
collect yeses amounting to more than 50% of the total voting power for it to be adopted.

This proposal introduces an initial version of wait-for-quiet: a means of adopting proposals without
requiring absolute majority by having a dynamic proposal deadline that is extended if the proposal is controversial.

For a proposal to be adopted in this way, it first needs to collect more yeses than nos and at least
3% of the total voting power for yes. If at the end of the (dynamic) deadline this is the case, then the proposal is adopted.
                       As part of liquid democracy, neuron holders can choose to follow the voting choices of other neurons. This can be done manually, but a very common and consumer-friendly way is to use the ‘follow neuron’ functionality in the NNS Frontend dapp. To further decentralization, this proposal is to add cycle_dao’s neuron: 5967494994762486275.                      Update subnet tdb26-jop6k-aogll-7ltgs-eruif-6kk7m-qpktf-gdiqx-mxtrf-vb5e6-eqe to replica version 32d4e9c61c8b284d1bebed290df8d9b2efad2fc6

Motivation: Upgrade the NNS subnet (tdb26) to rc--2021-10-24_18-31

### New features

* Change the ("long") voting period from 48h to 24h:

How that we have "wait for quiet", the voting period for ordinary proposals (not exchange rate proposals) can be reduced as "wait for quiet" will extend the voting period when necessary.

## Release notes

Seed allotments that were unclaimed after 6 months were going to be swept to a foundation-controlled neuron, which would allow the foundation to arbitrate claims by those who say they lost their keys, and forward them on appropriately. Owing to difficulties it has encountered, the foundation realizes it cannot play this role.

This proposal removes the sweep mechanism, except for four participants that have already been successfully processed by the foundation. In the future, an NNS update could make it possible for the NNS, which runs under the control of the decentralized community, to perform this role itself.

       Remove node(s) wmes6-4n5sh-5bxhm-eakb6-4vvt4-wz6uy-reuzr-hygu2-4qywf-ty4nz-bqe from the Registry.

Motivation: This is the dirty node that was just removed from the NNS subnet. Before reuse it needs to be completely redeployed.

      ## Proposal to Upgrade the Cycles Minting Canister

### Proposer: Dfinity Foundation
### New Wasm Hash: 3c56f5186056433ccc65a7072c9459e03e28fc70080016cf906005a267931818
### Target canister: rkp4c-7iaaa-aaaaa-aaaca-cai

---
## Release notes

### New features
* Conversion rate now stored in and retrievable from the CMC
    * When minting cycles, if the CMC does not have a value set for the rate (i.e. when the upgrade first succeeds), it will pull the rate from the Registry. If the rate is missing in the Registry as well, it refunds the user their ICP.
* 30-day moving average conversion rate now stored in and retrievable from the CMC
* Both of the new queries are certified every time they need to be queried
          ## Proposal to Upgrade the Registry Canister

### Proposer: Dfinity Foundation
### New Wasm Hash: dfd271d8df22cc3b608addb8dabd780377b72212e9e91bcf506e3d413cf9ee86
### Target canister: rwlgt-iiaaa-aaaaa-aaaaa-cai

---
## Release notes

## New features
* Add `ecdsa_config` field to Subnet records (corresponding to the respective feature flag)
* Add fields for SSH access to Subnet records. Permissions are for "readonly" and "backup" access.
* New record introduced for SSH access to unassigned nodes. Permissions are for "readonly" and "backup" access.
* P2P gossip behavior was changes; the `relay_config`, `GossipAdvertRelayConfig`, and `relay_percentage` Subnet record fields and payload structs have been replaced by the more agnostic `advert_config`, `best_effort_percentage`, and `GossipAdvertConfig`.

### Improvements
* Changes to the algorithm that the Registry uses to certify deltas. It doesn't build the hash tree from scratch every time anymore. A merklized `RbTree` provided by the `ic-certified-map` library is used instead. This changes the complexity of update certification from O(|updates|) to
O(log(|updates|)). The tree still needs to be built from scratch after an upgrade, however.

Virtual people parties establish the personhood of otherwise pseudonymous identities. In a virtual people party, a small group of users validates each others’ personhood in a process that is fast, easy, and anonymous! Validated users may then achieve benefits such as increased voting power in the governance system or additional capabilities in social media dapps.

Motivation: Upgrade the subnet 15 (pjljw) to rc--2021-11-09_18-31
  Upgrading a canister can be a dangerous task. It can break clients due to a Candid interface change. It can also discard Motoko stable state due to a change in stable declarations. There are already several reports from the forum about people losing data after an upgrade (https://github.com/dfinity/motoko/issues/2692).This proposal promises to check these properties statically before attempting the canister upgrade, so that 1) existing clients depending on it and not (yet) being aware of the upgrade will continue to function; 2) the new canister should be able to read the contents of existing stable variables, and not to accidentally lose data after an upgrade. To support this feature in dfx, we also need a way to expose canister metadata, such as the Candid interface from the Wasm module. We are exposing the metadata in the state tree to allow users to download this metadata in a certified manner.

   This proposal sets the newly introduced subnet configuration field `max-block-payload-size` to 4MiB.

Currently, `max-block-payload-size` is not used yet, but a future replica upgrade is planned which improves how block size is allocated.
Instead of reserving space for ingress messages and crossnet messages separately, each type can fully fill the block size, up to a combined size limit of `max-block-payload-size`.
The value of 4MiB was chosen based on benchmarks, showing that such large blocks can still be handled.

Increase the node operator capacity to match the amount of available machines                  This proposal sets the newly introduced subnet configuration field `max-block-payload-size` to 4MiB.

Currently, `max-block-payload-size` is not used yet, but a future replica upgrade is planned which improves how block size is allocated.
Instead of reserving space for ingress messages and crossnet messages separately, each type can fully fill the block size, up to a combined size limit of `max-block-payload-size`.
The value of 4MiB was chosen based on benchmarks, showing that such large blocks can still be handled.

   The cycle_dao organization makes this motion to postpone for 6 months the Proposal to Change Dissolve Delay Bonus and Age Bonus Parameters that is currently in deliberation at https://forum.dfinity.org/t/proposal-to-change-dissolve-delay-bonus-and-age-bonus-parameters/8661

The rationale for the proposal is good, but at this time the cycle_dao believes more data should be collected before changing the core economics of the NNS. Postponing this proposal will provide an opportunity for broader community consultation and more data for modelling. After this 6 month period, a proposal could be submitted based on the conditions at the time.

One subject to interrogate during this time is the cost/benefit of locking up large volumes of ICP over a range of time frames.

A second subject is how, or possibly whether to proactively engage neuron holders in the governance process.

## Release notes

### New features
* Added the conversion rate 30-day history in the CMC's post-upgrade call so that the 30-day moving average can be used.
  * The manual addition will be removed once in effect, in a subsequent CMC upgrade.
                                                                  The proposal unlocks all neurons associated with the listed principal IDs of neuron owners that have passed KYC verification.                                                                                                                                                                  Fixed an issue where a user's expired session can lead to triggering code related to hardware wallets, even if the user has no hardware wallet accounts. Also fixed an issue where the 'Session expired' dialog didn't redirect to the login page after the user clicked Ok.

Due to the wait-for-quiet algorithm, a proposal’s voting period can be dynamically increased, depending on the neurons’ votes. In particular, wait-for-quiet ensures that proposals where all voters agree can be decided quickly while controversial proposals, where the voting outcome is turned from a Yes-majority to a No-majority or vice versa, are open for a longer period.

Currently, each proposal’s voting period is initially set to 24 hours and can be extended for at most another 24 hours by wait-for-quiet. That is, currently each proposal is open for at least 24 hours and at most 48 hours. We propose to increase the minimum voting period for proposals to 4 days and to increase maximum voting period extension due to wait-for-quiet to 4 days, resulting in a maximum voting period of 8 days.

Updating Internet Identity to b434acea3831e4317cf20c26488f1d31570dd35b to add security headers and CAPTCHA, and improve some of the authentication and anchor creation flows.

## Rationale:

This is a fairly big upgrade that includes a lot of improvements since November 15th:

* We now warn the user if they are trying to use a seed phrase for the wrong anchor (by comparing the first digits if they exist)
* The seed phrase itself is _not_ translated by Chrome anymore, even if the user has enabled page translation.
* The "recovery" warning is now less dramatic for non-Safari users, and it is made clear to the user that they can skip adding a recovery.
* The "recovery" warning is now more concise (and precise) for Safari users.
* The user is now nudged to write down their newly created anchors.
* A CAPTCHA challenge is introduced during anchor creation.
* Security headers are added when serving assets.
* Various code and typo fixes. For the full list of Pull Requests, see below.

            Update subnet io67a-2jmkw-zup3h-snbwi-g6a5n-rm5dn-b6png-lvdpl-nqnto-yih6l-gqe to replica version 75138bbf11e201aac47266f07bee289dc18a082b

Motivation: Upgrade the subnet 6 (io67a) to rc--2021-12-06_18-31
                   ## Summary:

Updating Internet Identity to 395eb44bdb519574f13231ccf9ff0dfc2d159950

## Rationale:

This is mostly a bugfix for an issue where the confirmation screen would be shown even if the Identity could not be created. We now also set the security headers in case of an error on `/metrics`.

Detailed list of changes since last release:
```
~/code/internet-identity main
❯ git log --oneline --first-parent mainnet-33735..HEAD src/
395eb44 (HEAD) Don't ask for confirmation on webauthn failure (#488)
728ddd0 Also send security headers in the metrics error case (#486)
```

The wasm sha256 is
```
17ddf60ebd232d449519ff26d10a621bd672b9d6a58388ebb1fc03b671d89d75
```
as confirmed by a local build by me and by CI: https://github.com/dfinity/internet-identity/runs/4505607925?check_suite_focus=true

The affected canister id is `rdmx6-jaaaa-aaaaa-aaadq-cai` and the desired install mode is `upgrade`.

## Areas Affected:

Internet Identity

  # Replace a node in subnet tdb26.

- Step 1 (this proposal): Add nodes [5jf3x]
- Step 2 (upcoming proposal): Remove nodes [tnfdy]
           ##1. Intro: Changes to governance proposals and voting reward weights

Today, before the proposed change, all proposals are rewarded equally. This means that automatic voting through following on exchange rate proposals, which happens every 10 minutes (circa 144 times per day) and maintenance proposals (typically 1-6 per weekday) provide the same voting rewards as a deliberate manual vote on a motion proposal. This means that neuron holders deliberating and manually voting on motion proposals have a negligible impact on their voting rewards.

This proposal, by Johan Granstrom, is to make two changes to incentivize more community participation in the governance process.

You can read forum conversation here: https://forum.dfinity.org/t/changes-to-governance-proposals-and-voting-reward-weights-proposal/9172

### a. Disable default following for proposals on the governance topic

First, we want to disable default following for proposals on the governance topic (which currently includes motion and uninstall proposals). The main reason for this change is that most neurons follow the beacon neuron of the Internet Computer Association (neuron #28) as this has been the default value since Genesis. For most neuron holders, it makes sense to follow the ICA beacon neuron for maintenance proposals, like adding and removing nodes and upgrading the replica version. However, for governance proposals, the ICA or the DFINITY Foundation should not be the arbiters. While we encourage neuron holders to deliberate and manually vote governance proposals, neuron holders that do not want to manually vote on governance proposals can still configure their neurons to explicitly follow a neuron or set of neurons that they trust on the governance topic.

### b. Weigh the voting rewards based on the topic

Second, we want to weigh the voting rewards based on the topic so that exchange rate proposals receive a much smaller weight (our proposal is 0.01) and governance proposals (motions in particular) gain a much higher weight (our proposal is 20). Proposals on other topics have a weight of one.

## 2. Motivation for the proposal

In a typical week, the total weight of exchange rate proposals will be roughly 10 (144 * 7 * 0.01) and maintenance proposals will add up to a weight in the range of 5 to 30 (based on historical data).

As a significant portion of voting rewards will now come from voting on governance proposals, neuron holders have a strong incentive to either vote directly on all governance proposals or explicitly configure their neurons to follow such proposals.

##3. Further background 

Neuron holders have been able to change their default followees since Genesis, as well as specifying overrides for specific topics, but this feature is not yet widely used.

As a final note, if this proposal is adopted, the NNS dapp user interface will be updated to say *All Topics Except Governance* instead of *All Topics*.

### 4. Consequences of this motion

a. If it passes, there will be subsequent NNS proposals to update the code of the NNS Dapp and NNS

b. If this proposal fails, the status quo will remain. ## 1. Intro: Changes to governance proposals and voting reward weights

## Release notes

## New features
* New endpoint which calculates and returns the monthly Node Provider rewards.
* Pruning in post-upgrade hook can now help with removing stale/irrelevant records.
  * This feature is used to remove the deprecated `xdr_per_icp` key from the Registry store.

### Improvements
* Additional invariant checks added to the replica version field in unassigned node config records.
* `MAX_NUM_SSH_KEYS` for unassigned nodes config is now `100`.
* `get_versions_since` now returns a variable-size paginated response instead of a hardcoded amount of 1000 deltas.

## Release notes

## Fixes
- Fix the bug introduced by the previous upgrade, where we deleted entries from the registry corresponding to the now unneeded exchange rates: the registry is expecting contiguous sequences of entries and it breaks some clients that these are no longer contiguous. The fix applied in this release is to add dummy entries in lieu of the missing ones.

          ## 1. Objective

This motion proposal is about the efforts of integrating the Internet Computer (IC) with Ethereum, which comprises the following items:

* **Ethereum blockchain integration:** Integrating the Internet Computer blockchain with the Ethereum blockchain in a trustless manner, i.e., without using any trusted intermediaries such as bridges. This will enable smart contracts on the Internet Computer to call smart contracts on Ethereum and vice versa.

* **EVM support on the IC:** Providing an Ethereum execution environment (EVM) on the Internet Computer to run Solidity-/EVM-based smart contracts on the IC.

This proposal, being one of the R&D roadmap proposals, is different to our usual motion proposals for individual features that have been launched so far because it covers a multi-year strategic roadmap of R&D activities in a specific domain and likely results in multiple features on which we will have separate motion proposals. The proposal expresses the current thinking and intends to trigger a discussion process with the community to refine it towards the work on the individual features of the proposal.
The integration with the Ethereum blockchain and the EVM support on the IC must be aligned with each other in order to reap the most benefits from this strategic line of work.

## 2. Background
Smart contracts on blockchains like the Internet Computer or Ethereum can call other smart contracts on the same blockchain they are running on, but not on different blockchains. A blockchain is a walled garden in some way that is per se not openly connected with other systems and specifically other blockchains. The reasons behind this are technical and based on how blockchains work: It is not straightforward to deliver calls from a blockchain to another target blockchain and the results back in a trustless manner. Particularly, signing transactions for other blockchains is difficult given the trust model that any single node can be compromised and thus cannot hold private key material required to sign a transaction for the other blockchain it wants to interact with.
Regarding the other problem domain, most smart contracts today  are written in Solidity as they have originally targeted Ethereum and the language and surrounding ecosystem are well known by the community. However, Ethereum has become prohibitively expensive for running smart contracts at scale (especially ones with lots of data) due to its lack of scalability and massively increased demand in recent years. Thus, authors of smart contracts are looking for alternative blockchains with lower transaction, storage, and compute costs and possible other advantages like fast transaction finality and high throughput. It is crucial that Solidity-based smart contracts be portable with little effort and without major changes, because those contracts often have been running successfully and have been thoroughly audited and every change may introduce exploitable bugs and should therefore be avoided.

## 3. Why this is important
The interoperability between different blockchains is of increasing importance: As there is an increasing number of blockchains, the smart contracts of th world are distributed across those blockchains: So far, Ethereum has been the chain with most of the contracts running, but increasingly they have been moving to Layer-2 chains or other Layer-1 chains for lower operational cost. Now that contracts are spread over a diverse landscape of chains, the capability to make inter-blockchain calls and receive back the responses is becoming increasingly important for the future open blockchain ecosystem. A particularly important aspect of integration between different blockchains is the transfer of value between the chains. This is also getting increasingly important now that liquidity is spread over a growing number of blockchains: Ideally, people can hold liquidity on a particular chain and easily transfer it to another chain and utilize it there to earn interest on the tokens. Take as an example Ether, native currency of Ethereum,, and the plurality of other ERC-20 tokens on Ethereum, e.g., those that are wrapped tokens of other cryptocurrencies that have been bridged to Ethereum. All those can be made available on the IC in a trustless manner with the integration between the IC and Ethereum. That is, token holders on Ethereum or on other chains that are bridged to Ethereum could benefit by using their tokens in a wrapped form on the IC and the IC would benefit in terms of a massive potential of liquidity influx from other blockchains. This would leverage the properties of the IC of being massively scalable, having very fast finality, and offering extremely cheap computation compared to other blockchains.
EVM support on the IC is the other aspect of the Ethereum integration that can provide substantial value to both the community and the IC. The IC, once offering an EVM integration, will be the best-suited platform for running Solidity-/EVM-based smart contracts due to its very low cycles cost, fast finality, and unbounded scalability. This will allow smart contract authors to bring their contracts over to the IC and benefit from all those properties the IC offers. This can be done without major modifications to the contracts, i.e., without the risk of introducing bugs or invalidating the audits that have been done.

## 4. Topics under this project
**Ethereum blockchain integration**
The basic idea of the integration with the Ethereum blockchain is to perform a trustless integration between the IC and Ethereum blockchains analogous to the Bitcoin integration with the Internet Computer. This integration enables smart contracts on Ethereum to call smart contracts on the Internet Computer and receive the call result as a response and vice versa. This integration will comprise a fully functional cross-chain integration between the Internet Computer and Ethereum, allowing smart contracts on one blockchain to call smart contracts on the respective other chain and thereby create substantial innovation potential. Particularly, Ether will be transferable to smart contracts on the IC and be wrappable for DeFi applications. The same will be true for any ERC-20 token due to the generality of the approach. The integration will leverage threshold cryptography to achieve our trust properties.

**EVM support on the IC**
The Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) is the first VM, in addition to our default Wasm execution environment, that we want to deploy on the IC and an important part of this motion proposal.
EVM support will make it possible to deploy EVM-based smart contracts on the Internet Computer. Having EVM support brings about multiple benefits for the community, such as low cycle costs for running smart contracts, low finalization latency, and network effects of being able to deploy readily-available, time-tested, audited Solidity-based smart contracts, avoiding the liquidity bootstrapping process.
The main technical challenge in this area will be addressing the impedance mismatch between the asynchronous architecture of the Internet Computer and the synchronous EVM.

## 5. Key milestones 
As this is a multi-year R&D motion proposal, it is at the current time not possible to give detailed milestones. We expect that each of the features resulting from this R&D motion proposal will have similar milestones reflecting our engineering process: System design, MVP implementation, extensions to the MVP. The detailed milestones will be defined once the individual features will be worked on.

 ## 6. Discussion leads
Dieter Sommer (@dieter.sommer) is driving the proposal, and will be joined by Thomas Locher (@THLO) and Timo Hanke (@timo) for the forum discussions.

## 7. Why the DFINITY Foundation should make this a long-running R&D project
The functionalities we target with this motion proposal are not straightforward to implement and will likely be developed and rolled out in a staged fashion, starting with an MVP and adding additional functionality in multiple rounds later. We intend to roll out an MVP that provides value as quickly as possible so that our community can benefit from this. We think this is absolutely crucial due to the fast moving domain, particularly in the area of EVM-compatible blockchains. Advanced functionality will be added later on and provide additional value. This approach fits well into a multi-year R&D proposal: It will require original research to tackle the hard problems that are open in terms of their solution,whereas work on problems that merely require significant engineering efforts can be tackled sooner. We also intend to work tightly with our community w.r.t. the features associated with this motion proposal.

## 8. Skills and Expertise necessary to accomplish this
What we intend to provide as outcome of this motion proposal requires people with a plurality of different advanced skills:
* System design
* System-level and software engineering
* Algorithms, complexity theory
* Probability theory
* Cryptography

* Deep understanding of Internet Computer consensus
* API design

The following teams have been identifier of being involved:
* Research
* Networking
* Consensus
* Message Routing
* Execution
* NNS
* Security
* SDK

## 9. Open Research questions
We have already identified some of the research questions, the list will likely grow further during the work on the features:
* Trustless blockchain integration between the IC and Ethereum
* Consensus protocol extensions for the trustless integration
* Threshold cryptography
* Security modeling of the system
* Proving security of the system
* Questions related to the advanced system design
* Testing and providing a testing infrastructure for the users of the feature
* Addressing the impedance mismatch between the asynchronous IC and synchronous EVM

## 11. What we are asking the community
* Review comments, ask questions, give feedback on developer forum: https://forum.dfinity.org/t/long-term-r-d-integration-with-the-ethereum-network/9382/6?u=dieter.sommer
* Vote accept or reject on NNS Motion  ## 1. Objective
The objective of this initiative is to integrate the Internet Computer with outside systems. We have identified multiple classes of external systems of interest in this domain: The Web 2.0, i.e., HTTP(S) and other standard protocols, other blockchains, and end user devices. As can be observed, these are quite different integrations collectively put together in this motion proposal. Ultimately, the goal of integrating the Internet Computer with such systems is to provide greater value to both the IC and the systems it integrates with.

## 2. Background
A blockchain is per se isolated from other systems outside of it. The standard defined interaction pattern with the outside world is that of users interacting with the blockchain by submitting transactions (or queries) and obtaining responses. The blockchain nodes cannot arbitrarily call out to servers on the Internet to retrieve data or send transactions to smart contracts on other blockchains. Replicas directly obtaining data from external data sources would likely break the consensus layer because different replicas would receive different responses (e.g., due to timestamps, unique ids, or changed data due to differences in the times when the requests were made). Blockchains solve the problem of providing external data to smart contracts through so-called oracles, the realization of which spans a spectrum from centralized to decentralized architectures. In every instance, though, external parties, the oracles, are required to provide data, thus complicating the overall trust assumptions of the smart contracts and increasing operational cost.
Making transactions to other blockchains is even more difficult in that transactions need to be signed and in the trust model of blockchains, network nodes cannot securely hold a signature private key, so threshold cryptography or trusted entities need to be used. Most integrations we see as of now are based on wrapping tokens of other chains through (centralized) bridges to enable DeFi use cases. General invocations between smart contracts on different chains are harder, but there are efforts of standardizing protocols for this purpose.
A quite different problem domain is the currently widespread use of proprietary centralized public cloud services through end users, e.g., through mobile apps that make use of these cloud services through easy-to-use SDKs provided by the cloud vendors. A good example for this are SDKs that offer cloud storage services to apps. There are no SDKs yet that would offer the functionality of the Internet Computer to mobile app developers in an easy-to-use manner. This should be addressed as part of this integration proposal. In contrast to integrating the IC with external systems, this is rather a use case where IC functionality is made available to end users via app SDKs, much like this is prominently done with cloud services these days.

## 3. Why this is important
The Internet Computer as a standalone system can already provide great value by offering a platform for running smart contracts at web-speed and even serving the frontend from the blockchain. However, many interesting types of smart contracts, such as decentralized finance (DeFi) smart contracts or decentralized insurance smart contracts, require external data in order to function. Such smart contracts are referred to as *hybrid smart contracts* as they, in addition to what is available on chain, also rely on external data for their logic. Thus, a solution that allows canisters to directly make HTTP requests to outside servers, an integration with existing oracle networks, or a proprietary oracle network is crucial for enabling vital use cases on the Internet Computer.
The integration with other blockchains can be considered the next level of integration with external systems and enables further use cases: If we would have broad inter-chain connectivity among the top blockchains, smart contracts on all chains could interact with each other, thereby opening up a plethora of new use cases and leveraging network effects. An intermediate step towards this would be a broad availability of wrapped tokens of other blockchains on the Internet Computer. Besides the availability of external data, the availability of tokens of other chains is crucial for certain exciting high-value use cases such as decentralized exchanges (DEXs).

## 4. Topics under this project
We currently see the following topics of interest under the umbrella of this initiative:
* **HTTP(S) support for canisters**
An important integration for the Internet Computer is the one with the current Web 2.0 infrastructure by allowing canisters to make HTTP(S) calls to servers on the Internet. This is a non-trivial problem in multiple ways:
  * The replicas of the IC each need to make the same call and obtain consensus over the result. However, results can differ, e.g., because of unique identifiers, timestamps, or slightly deviating numerical values, e.g., for quotes. Those differences need to be accounted for when bringing the HTTP call results through IC consensus.
  * Calls that change the state in the invoked external service, i.e., are not idempotent, pose another interesting challenge.
Having an HTTP call mechanism enables a wide range of applications, e.g., oracle services directly integrated into the Internet Computer in a trustless manner, user notifications, and anything else that requires communication with servers on the Internet.
* **Support of further protocols for canisters**
Besides HTTP, we intend to support other relevant protocols to integrate with Web 2.0 systems. To this end, we need to further investigate which protocols should be considered. Community input about which protocols to consider and the use cases this would solve will be greatly appreciated.
* **Oracles**
An important part of this multi-year integration strategy are oracles. Oracles are crucial for providing data such as stock quotes, cryptocurrency, or any other relevant market data for DeFi, weather data for decentralized insurance applications, or any sort of interesting data feeds to smart contracts on the IC. The functionality of canisters making HTTP calls is closely related to oracles, however in a first iteration, HTTP calls will not provide all functionality the most powerful oracle services of today. Thus, we want to also investigate an integration with existing oracle services, e.g., Chainlink, to leverage existing oracle ecosystems that are readily available and immediately benefit from the accompanying network effects.
* **Blockchain integrations**
Particularly the domain of DeFi applications, e.g., decentralized exchanges (DEXs), integrations with other blockchains and specifically their respective native cryptocurrencies, besides Bitcoin and Ethereum, is of relevance. The Foundation does not have the resources to integrate with all other blockchains of interest, and therefore considers, as part of this motion proposal, to provide a blueprint or framework to enable the community to implement such integrations on their own or to use upcoming integration services. This will open up the Internet Computer for a plethora of exciting DeFi use cases that are not yet possible in their entirety.
* **End user device integration**: Cloud SDK alternatives
Another quite different topic in the area of this motion proposal are blockchain alternatives to the cloud integration SDKs for mobile operating systems with API compatibility. Such cloud SDKs are currently available on the iOS and Android mobile platforms and allow users to, for example, store data on legacy cloud systems. Providing an API-compatible alternative to those SDKs would allow users to (almost transparently) use the same APIs (or a subset thereof) to perform the same functionality on the blockchain instead of the traditional cloud. A specific use case here would be storage of data. This could help users move from the Web 2.0 world of proprietary cloud stacks to an open blockchain world with many of their daily computing needs. This is quite different to the other integrations as it is rather a use case of the Internet Computer in the context of replacing traditional cloud computing technology.

## 5. Key milestones (and technical solution if known)
As this is a multi-year R&D initiative, we can currently not yet provide the concrete milestones for the individual features. Each feature will require milestones for the finalized system design, a PoC or MVP implementation, and further milestones for specific core functionalities. We plan to take an agile approach for the initiative in that we prioritize the functionalities, together with the community, and provide implementations early on to provide best possible value to the community. This will imply an agile approach of delivering MVPs initially that provide basic 
functionality and later expanding the functionality based on what is most needed.

## 6. Discussion leads
Dieter Sommer, Thomas Locher, Timo Hanke 

## 7. Why the DFINITY Foundation should make this a long-running R&D project
The features addressed in this initiative motion proposal cover a broad spectrum of functionality and require substantial R&D efforts to bring them to the market. Basic functionality of the features may be relatively fast to implement, but more advanced functionality will require time for the underlying research efforts to develop feasible solutions to the problems. Based on those, system designs and implementations thereof need to be produced. Considering the expected breath and depth of this initiative, we think it can only be tackled through a multi-year initiative that is operated in an agile manner.

## 8. Skills and Expertise necessary to accomplish this (maybe teams?)
Due to the complexity of the initiative, we require teams with a broad selection of skills as outlined next:
* System design
* System level software engineering
* Algorithms, complexity
* Probability theory
* Cryptography
* Technologies behind different blockchains
* Deep understanding of Internet Computer consensus
* Oracle technologies
* Mobile cloud SDKs
* API design

At least the following teams are likely required:
* Research
* Networking
* Consensus
* Message Routing
* Execution
* NNS
* Security
* SDK

## 9. Open research questions
* Consensus protocol extension for agreeing on HTTP(S) responses
* Response aggregation in consensus to realize oracle functionality without oracles
* Architecture for integrating HTTP(S) calling with the IC protocol stack and particularly the consensus layer
* Threshold cryptography
* Algorithm research required for the integrations (e.g., management of connections to other blockchain nodes, handling of incoming blockchain blocks, block processing, protocol between IC components to request and receive blocks)
* Analogous questions for different protocols to integrate (e.g., streaming protocols)
* Evaluation of oracle networks and definition of integration architecture
* General approach / blueprint to integrating with other blockchains
* Security modeling and proofs

  # Decentralized CA and DNS

## Summary

**Background:** The Internet Computer (IC) offers dapp developers a possibility to build and host Web dapps on the Internet Computer that are served completely end-to-end from the blockchain to a browser.

To ensure end-2-end security and verifiability of such content one needs to make decentralized blockchain-based certification compatible with the built-in browser tooling and verification mechanisms. Currently this is achieved by using additional software, so called service workers, certified by  "Let’s Encrypt ", which is one of the centralized certificate authorities (CA) accepted by browsers. There are also no built-in mechanisms to use custom domains for canister smart contracts running on Internet Computer.

**Objective:** This project aims to provide mechanisms that ensure custom domain names and seamless verification of the content that is served from the Internet Computer blockchain to any browser and guarantee end-2-end security without additional tooling, using built-in mechanisms only. This includes making the IC a decentralized Certificate Authority and providing a decentralized DNS on the IC.

## Why this is important and why the DFINITY Foundation should make this a long-running R&D project

All current PKI systems used by the browsers assume centralized trusted third parties to serve as roots of trust (certificate authorities). To achieve true decentralization it is important to enable a decentralized system to act as a root of trust and interface with the current tooling to allow using it seamlessly and securely.

Becoming a decentralized CA is not just technically challenging: besides implementing cryptographic operations in a distributed fashion (for example, using threshold signatures instead of simple signatures) it also requires work and cooperation with browser manufacturers to complete the process of becoming a (root) CA supported by different browsers. The latter especially takes time and also support from the legal and compliance teams.

## Key milestones & topics under this project

The project aims to achieve this goal via multiple steps (milestones):

1. Make the Internet Computer serve as a decentralized CA
   1.1 Technical enablement:
      -  Develop and implement multi-party computation protocols for TLS handshake
      - Develop and implement multi-party computation protocols for certifying the content (this includes the threshold ECDSA work that is in progress)
   
   1.2. Process and registration:
      - Apply to serve as a subordinate CA
      - Apply to serve as a root CA (to be able to certify any domain).

2. Enable decentralized DNS support for canister smart contracts hosted on IC
3. Ensure seamless content verification support for different platforms and browsers (via web or native Apps) with strong security guarantees. This includes integration with boundary nodes (see also Boundary Node project proposal).


## Skills and Expertise necessary to accomplish this

The problems described above require the cooperation of different experts: from researchers and engineerings working on Cryptography, PKI, Networking, and Web technologies (to build the technical foundation) to specialists in Security, Compliance and Legal (to ensure that the Internet Computer can serve as a decentralized CA and DNS service).

## What we are asking the community

Please review this proposal and provide us with any feedback you have regarding the boundary nodes. Please also review the other related proposals on trusted execution environments and boundary nodes. We invite you to engage in the discussion and hope it will be fruitful and useful for the IC community and for the future edge framework of the IC.

 ### Trusted execution enhanced IC 

The Internet Computer (IC) is a general infrastructure for a wide variety of applications processing all kinds of security-sensitive data ranging from user-centric private information to financial digital assets. While the IC as of today already provides a high level of fault-tolerance and security, all available technical means to improve its security and resilience should be explored. With the wide-spread advent of hardware-based trusted execution, the current protection of the IC against attacks such as rogue data centers providers and intrusions at the host level can be further strengthened and fortified.

### Objective

Devise a trusted execution harnessed IC to further increase its security in terms of integrity and privacy against privileged local attackers. Provide additional means for users to validate the integrity of the IC. Together, this will substantially increase the security of the IC and all its hosted assets and data.

### Background

In a nutshell, recent hardware-aided trusted execution support ensures that code and data outside the CPU is handled in an encrypted form and only decrypted, while being processed by a secured execution context inside the CPU. In addition, remote attestation makes it possible to validate that the secured execution context has been initialized on trustworthy hardware in a certain state, thereby comprising only the requested code and data.

The IC is deployed and managed via tailored virtual machines that serve its code and data. Accordingly, trusted execution should be applied at the level of whole virtual machine instances as this puts all necessary code and data under its protection and is a natural fit. This scope also limits the integration overhead and paves the way for interoperability between different trusted execution technologies.

### Why this is important

Securing the decentralized infrastructure of the IC is a key concern of the DFINITY Foundation. Along these lines the admission process of new node providers will be more and more relaxed with the aim to enable rapid growth and empower the community to participate in all matters of the IC. However, attached with a lightweight process to become a node provider, there is also the risk of abuse and the integration of improperly secured environments. In order to address these concerns, trusted execution will be utilized to additionally protect the virtual machines of the IC against unauthorized access from local privileged attackers. As a consequence the integration of trusted execution can be considered as an enabler for the further growth and decentralization of the IC.

### Proposal

To make the IC and its software ready for trusted execution, current technology has to be evaluated. As a prime candidate, AMD SEV-SNP as an upcoming technology that provides mechanisms to secure virtual machines and flexible remote attestation is considered. Furthermore, technologies such as TDX from Intel will be explored.

Independent of the utilized technology, the current build and deployment process of the IC virtual machines has to be tailored for trusted execution. In particular, a deterministic build process and virtual machine instantiation enabling remote attestation has to be designed and implemented. While the IC virtual machines are already secured against various attacks, additional security measures have to be implemented to protect against local privileged attackers. Basing on this extended support, the IC will make use of remote attestation to enable the vetted integration of new virtual machine instances. The IC protocol will have to be extended to enable remote attestation performed from multiple locations to account for malicious nodes, thereby matching the failure model of the IC. The protocol extensions will undergo a security review and an approach for the migration has to be devised.

In the beginning, the plan is to focus on a certain trusted execution technology for the initial deployment, next the focus will be widened and at least one further technology will be investigated. The core motivation is not to depend on a single hardware provider and to devise the trusted execution support for the IC to be as vendor-neutral as possible.

While the work outlined so far primarily focuses on the internal security of the IC, it must be possible for the end-users to validate these enhancements in such a way that a user will perform remote attestation implicitly by accessing the IC. As a consequence, hardware-aided end-to-end security between the user and the IC virtual machines can be established, which requires the design, development, and testing of additional software executed on the user-side.

### Key milestones

This motion proposal targets a long-term perspective and as such is planned for three years. Parts of it will be detailed and refined as the work progresses. At this stage six milestones are planned:

* M1: The build and deployment process of the IC is ready for applying trusted execution and performing remote attestation
* M2: Trusted execution has been deployed and secures the VMs of selected subnets featuring the next generation of the IC hardware
* M3: Remote attestation has been integrated into the IC protocol
* M4: Client-side validation via remote attestation of the IC nodes is enabled
* M5: Widespread integration of trusted execution to a majority of the IC nodes
* M6: Vendor-neutral support for trusted execution is enabled and demonstrated

### Discussion leads

As members of the DFINITY research team Rüdiger Kapitza and Helge Bahmann will drive the proposal and are available for discussion.

### Why the DFINITY Foundation should make this a long-running R&D project

While trusted execution is marked-available for a few years now and cloud-vendors have launched initial commercial offerings it is still a cutting-edge technology that rapidly evolves and new hardware extensions as well as updates to existing ones will surface. Integrating such a promising but also disruptive technology requires carefully adapting and evolving central parts of the IC over the next few years. This gets especially visible with the aim to integrate trusted execution despite the strong hardware dependencies as vendor-neutral as possible.

### Skills and Expertise necessary to accomplish this

The implementation of this motion proposal will require a diverse set of expertise as applying trusted execution to the IC is a cross-cutting endeavour. At the lowest level it demands a solid understanding of the trusted execution hardware including being able to access and possibly mitigate aspects of side-channel attacks. At the system level the integration of the hardware into the operating system and the virtualization layer has to be performed and existing hardware-vendor support extended for the demands of the IC. Based on the devised system layer the offered functionality and services of the trusted execution hardware have to be integrated into the protocol of the IC.

To conclude the required expertise spans topics related to hardware security, operating systems, systems security and the engineering of distributed protocols.

In line with the above stated expertise and skills this will be a strong multi-team. In particular it is expected that initially the node team that is responsible for the operating system of the IC will lead the proposal. However, as the work progresses other teams such as the consensus and networking as well as the SDK team will play an increasingly important role. Finally, as the results of the proposal will need to be tested and deployed additional teams will be involved.

### Open Research questions

Strengthening the security of IC by the crosscutting-integration of trusted execution poses a unique research challenge. While applying trusted execution to distributed applications has recently been a subject of various research efforts, there is to our knowledge no operative decentralized system that is near to the size of the IC which already employs trusted execution. In particular, this notion proposal will answer the following research questions:

* How to integrate trusted execution in a scalable and decentralized infrastructure such as the IC? Any centralized control should be avoided.
* How to design and implement a vendor-neutral system support for trusted execution? As the IC evolves the transparent use of different trusted execution technology should be enabled.
* How to seamlessly integrate trusted execution into the IC protocol so distributed remote attestation that matches the fault model the IC becomes possible?
* How to empower the users in validating the security of the IC via remote attestation? This validation step should be transparent while accessing the IC and not only directed to the accessed machine but span, for example, all nodes of a subnet.

### Examples where community can integrate into project

Due to the wide scope of required expertise for this motion proposal it is expected that it will be carried out in tight interaction with the community. In particular it is planned to organize workshops as the motion proposal evolves to discuss hardware security, system integration and protocol integration. Especially, in scope of diversifying the hardware support the community could enable a rapid evolution. Furthermore, a critical assessment and discussion regarding the security implications of the utilized hardware is of strong interest.

### What we are asking the community

Trusted execution is a novel and rapidly evolving technology that will require intense discussion and exchange to integrate it in a vendor-neutral and future-proof fashion. While hardware-based security is on the rise it also comes attached with concerns and vulnerabilities will surface. All along the implementation of this motion proposal a constant exchange with the community is essential to make it a success. Accordingly, we welcome comments, questions and feedback and hope for a positive vote on the proposal.

### Community Proposal: 3-year Plan Dapp Governance

### ## Objective

With this project, we plan to provide building blocks that allow dapp developers to operate decentralized and open governance systems and integrate them with their dapps.
Concretely, we plan to deliver such building blocks in multiple stages, such that the community can make use of intermediate deliverables while the systems can continuously be evolved and improved.

### ## Background & Why this is important

Currently, most dapps that are realized as canister smart contracts on the Internet Computer blockchain are either controlled by some developers or have no controller at all. Both situations are undesirable. In the case where a dapp is controlled by a centralized group of developers, users of the dapp must trust these developers not to stop the service or to upgrade the canister code with some undesirable behavior. In the case where the canister has no controller, it cannot be upgraded at all, even though this might be necessary, for example to fix security bugs or to add new features.

This problem can be solved by assigning an open governance system to a dapp, where anyone can participate. The open governance can then autonomously control the upgrades and changes of the dapp.

Apart from decentralization, another concern for dapp developers is tokenization. Tokenization enables the introduction of new incentive systems and use cases that have the potential to set apart dapps from traditional applications.
Tokenizing a dapp allows, for instance, that anyone in the world can purchase tokens and thereby contribute to initial funding for the dapp. Moreover, tokens can be paid to early adopters and active users, which will help attract users.

The full potential of these advantages can be unlocked by a tokenized open governance system, where tokens can be locked to participate in voting. Anyone with locked tokens, including the users that were rewarded with tokens, can submit and vote on governance proposals for the dapp. By participating in governance, developers, users, and other investors can collectively decide what new features should be implemented. As their tokens are locked, they will be incentivized to vote taking into consideration the future value of the tokens and the dapp.

Finally, projects could have access to even more funding by allowing the ICP utility tokens that are locked in Network Nervous System (NNS) neurons to be invested in the above mentioned open governance systems.

### ## Topics under this project

This project contains topics such as tokenization, open governance, dapp upgrades, and tokenomics.

### ## Key milestones

While the longer term milestones are still subject to research and community feedback (e.g., what is needed in 1 year), we see the following concrete milestones in the next few months:
* The implementation of a ledger canister,
* the implementation of an open governance canister,
* support for operating the above canisters, such as upgrading and releasing them, and
* frontend integration for these canisters.

Moreover, these are some possible medium term milestones, that have to be concretized based on the outputs of the first projects and community feedback:

* An out of the box implementation of a tokenized, open governance system, called the Service Nervous System (SNS). Possible goals include the ability for a decentralized initial token distribution and a process for automated upgrades.
* The realization of community funds in the NNS and their integration with SNSs such that locked ICP utility tokens can be invested in SNSs.

### ## Why the DFINITY Foundation should make this a long-running R&D project

Apart from the above mentioned motivation for this effort, some of the main reasons for making this a long-term R&D project are:

* The project addresses a need from the community, as multiple dapp developers expressed interest in a solution for open governance.
* Since tokenization allows dapps to set up new incentives systems, this effort may attract new developers to the Internet Computer, which is beneficial for the whole platform.

### ## Skills / Expertise necessary to accomplish this

* Governance, tokens, financial integration: expertise in these areas will be key to develop the necessary canisters and how they interact with each other
* Security: tokens & governance systems are highly security critical. Therefore, the expertise from security experts will be needed to prevent potential security issues.
* Community / growth: the experience in interacting with the community will help in ensuring that we build and prioritize those open governance features that are important for the developers on the Internet Computer.

### ## Design & Research challenges

To deliver the above features we need to resolve several design and research challenges, including the following:

1. Providing modularity and parametrization of the governance systems that can be integrated with the needs of different dapps, while also providing a concrete implementation that can be used immediately.
2. Designing a release and upgrade process that enables users of open governance systems to verify which code the ledger, governance and other critical canisters are running so that they can trust these systems and invest in them. One main challenge will be to provide a verification path that is as usable as possible so that users that do not have a technical background can also gain this trust.
3. Designing a release and upgrade process that is usable and possibly can be provided "as a service".
4. Understanding the economic implications arising from different ways of combining the ledger and governance canister.
5. Designing the support for a decentralized initial token distribution.
6. Understanding the economic and security implications of enabling the investment of stacked ICP utility tokens in SNS systems, such as ensuring that an SNSs cannot misuse the invested tokens and thereby negatively impact the value of the ICP utility tokens.
7. Enable additional possibilities for funding and investments in open governance systems. For example, ensure the availability of decentralized exchanges and their integration with the SNSs and other ledger canisters.
8. Understand how the open governance systems can be improved with insights from other projects, such as new tokenomics and other support for DeFi.
9. Allow the open governance systems to interoperate with external inputs, such as exchange rates.
10. Enable open governance systems to interoperate with and make use of new IC features such as the ETH and Bitcoin integrations.
11. Further evolve the functionality of the open governance systems to adapt to the needs of dapp users that will become clearer when the first open governance systems are used.

### ## Examples where community can integrate into project

The purpose of this project is to provide open governance canisters that can be integrated with a variety of dapps.

 # Performance motion proposal

## Objective

The current design and implementation of the IC protocol has been focused on simplicity and low engineering effort. While this suffices to demonstrate the possibilities of canister smart contracts, unleashing the full capacity of the IC requires a high-performance design and implementation. The goal of this project is to address bottlenecks and thus increase the performance of individual IC nodes, so that more query and update requests can be executed in the same amount of time.

This will involve improvements such as to the orthogonal persistence mechanism, NIC virtualization, OS and Canister scheduling, caching and the investigation of HW accelerators for compute-intensive tasks.

## Background

In order to handle growing demand for new and more elaborate applications, the IC needs to be able to scale to those new requirements.

Broadly speaking, there are two approaches to scalability: a system can scale out by adding more hardware (in our case, more subnetworks). This often happens alongside some form of partitioning, as parts of that extra hardware are supposed to run independently from each other. This partitioning often implies a loss of locality as application logic might have remote state.

In contrast, systems can also scale up by increasing the performance of individual machines by making them more powerful or achieving better resource utilization.

Both are important. This proposal focuses on scale-up, there is a separate proposal on the scale-out.

## Motivation

One approach to scalability of the IC is to scale out, i.e.:

* By adding more subnetworks to increase update request rate
* By adding more nodes to increase query request rate

Scaling out, however, comes at a cost due to less locality and extra communication across subnetworks:

* Xnet messages to communicate across subnetwork boundaries
* Increased message complexity for Consensus with more nodes per subnetwork

Because of those costs, relying exclusively on scale out to increase the IC capacity is insufficient. It is also important to scale up performance of individual nodes to achieve higher query/update request rates without adding additional nodes.

This also improves machine utilization, cost of operating hardware, as well as energy consumption.

## Topics under this project

In order to achieve our goals, the current bottlenecks must first be investigated, followed by the design and implementation of suitable mitigation strategies. This will involve research and development effort in many components and require a diverse set of engineers and researchers with expertise in Distributed Systems, Cryptography, Performance Analysis and Management, Operating Systems, and Networking and is expected to take multiple years.

The following are some examples of areas for optimizations that promise to improve IC node performance:

* Orthogonal persistence (OP): the IC uses orthogonal persistence as a programming abstraction to simplify memory management for canister smart contract developers. The IC OP implementation also determines resource consumption as the canister needs to be charged for its use of memory.
* Locality of data and code: TLB misses and page faults are extremely expensive on modern hardware and can severely hurt overall application performance. All existing code has to be measured to find occurrences of the ones that hurt performance.
* Synchronization primitives, lock contention: The IC is a platform that exhibits a large degree of parallelism, as requests to different canisters and query calls to the same canister can be executed in parallel. With a high degree of parallelism, synchronization and coordination across concurrent tasks can quickly become a bottleneck that prevents leveraging the available parallelism that the workload would permit.
* User-level networking: traditionally, a syscall is needed to send data across the network, since the OS needs to make sure concurrent and safe access to shared resources is provided to all processes running on the OS. Such overheads can be minimized by means of user-level network stacks, where NIC virtualization technology allows to expose virtual send and receive queues that can be directly accessed by processes without having to enter the kernel.
* Light-weight user-level scheduling: avoid expensive syscalls and entering the OS kernel when switching from one task to another.
* Scheduler optimizations: as IC subnetworks run state machine replication, scheduling decisions for the order in which requests are going to be executed have to be deterministic. However, suboptimal schedules limit resource utilization, since there is less flexibility locally. For example, this makes it hard to yield resources to other tasks while waiting for resources. Thus, optimizing the IC scheduler will likely require us to research how to optimize schedulers in this niche.
* Caching: many operations on IC nodes have to be executed repeatedly. This temporal locality motivates exploring the use of caching to improve hardware utilization. An example for this is signature verification.
* HW acceleration: many hardware accelerator chips exist that are optimized for certain tasks and typically achieve higher performance and lower energy consumption. The use of those likely makes sense in the context of the IC. An example are Smart NICs that offload network checksum calculation and help to avoid entering the kernel for each package that is transmitted to and from networks. Other examples are crypto accelerators optimized for cryptographic operations such as signature checking.

## Key milestones

* Benchmarking suites to identify bottlenecks
* Model typical applications running on the IC to use as workload for bottleneck analysis
* Expected performance improvements: one order of magnitude for the number of requests processed per machine per second without hurting request latency.

Based on those benchmarks, decisions on where optimizations are most likely to improve performance can be made and addressed in collaboration with experts from the respective components.


## Why the DFINITY Foundation should make this a long-running R&D project

The success of the IC crucially depends on its usefulness for executing general purpose applications and workloads.

If the IC is to truly achieve blockchain singularity, performance (and cost of execution) has to be similar to centralized cloud provider platforms.

## Skills and Expertise necessary to accomplish this

For this effort, experts across the entire stack are needed. Starting from engineers with a deep understanding of hardware characteristics to developers familiar with the Linux kernel up to the application level, where code will have to be restructured in order to achieve a better utilization of available hardware resources.

## Open Research questions

* How useful are hardware accelerators?
  * Crypto hardware
  * Smart NICs
  * Near-memory processing
  * NVM hardware
* Can performance competitive to centralized cloud solutions be achieved?

## Examples where community can integrate into project

* Suggestions for meaningful workloads
* Provide more application benchmarks
* Suggestions for and implementation of performance improvements

# Scalability Motion proposal

**Summary**

The current version of the Internet Computer protocol provides a solid foundation for the execution of canister smart contracts which can be enhanced and extended to realize the potential of the IC to serve millions of smart contracts. More precisely, the following shall be investigated and suitable mechanisms designed, analysed, implemented, and tested:

1. Many more subnets with frequent inter-canister calls across different subnets. The communication overhead for two canisters running on different subnets should be kept to a minimum and new nodes should be able to join subnets fast even if the state of the canisters they host is huge.
2. Large subnets with hundreds of nodes to tolerate a higher number of faulty nodes, yet exhibit low latency and high throughput for update calls.
3. Developers and users sending large messages to canisters as well as inter-canister messages.

To achieve this, the current bottlenecks are investigated and then suitable mitigation strategies are designed and implemented. This will involve research and development efforts in many components and require a diverse set of engineers and researchers with expertise in Distributed Systems, Cryptography, Performance Analysis and Management, Operating Systems, and Networking and is expected to take multiple years.

## Objective

Design, analyse, implement, and test a more scalable version of the IC protocol to achieve higher throughput, more nodes, efficient routing across subnetworks, faster state synchronization, and automatic distributed load balancing despite malicious entities participating in the protocol.

## Background

The IC currently comprises a system subnet for the NNS canisters running on 37 nodes and a bit more than two dozen app subnets each running on 13 nodes each and maintaining a total of a little over 400 GB of state. Most of the current traffic consists of update and query calls from users to smart contract canisters. With the projected growth and the smart contract canisters becoming more sophisticated, not only will the load on the IC increase, it will also change to feature more inter-canister messages. Moreover, higher security requirements on system subnets (and potentially other subnet types) benefit from higher numbers of nodes per subnet..

## Why this is important

This project will help developers and consumers of IC dapps in the following ways:

1. Decreased latency combined with higher throughput & availability - Thanks to the work described in this motion proposal, future versions of the IC protocol and its implementation will be more scalable and robust. As a consequence, developers and users will benefit from decreased latency and higher throughput and availability.
2. Lower the overhead experienced by users - An enhanced management of node and subnet configuration will simplify adding more nodes and subnets, which in turn alleviates the load per subnet and an improved routing for messages between subnets will lower the overhead experienced by users further.
3. Orthogonal to these measures, a higher number of nodes in important subnets like the NNS subnet or other system subnets is desirable to make them tolerate more faulty nodes.

## Topics under this project

In order to enhance the IC, an improved version supports more subnets with more nodes, larger messages and an efficient backup mechanism.

The design, implementation, testing, and analysis of these features will rely on research and development on the following non-exhaustive list of topics:

* New routing mechanisms with frequent inter-canister calls across different subnets, relying on deterministic or randomized overlays
* Traffic shaping and scheduling algorithms to provide quality of service guarantees despite Byzantine players
* Construction of overlays for efficient message dissemination within and between subnets and a robust mechanism to adapt the overlays over time.
* Efficient mechanisms to (re)join a subnet, peer discovery and state synchronization
* Chunking at different layers of the IC stack
* Speculative algorithms for the execution and verification of canister message processing
* Separating the dissemination of messages to canisters from ordering them
* Erasure coding for reliable broadcast
* Distributed monitoring and analysis
* Node and subnet configuration and key management in the NNS registry canister

## Key milestones

The following list of potential milestones indicate the ambitions for this project and will be adapted to suitable values as the corresponding work packages are tackled.
Input on the prioritization of the different milestones is highly appreciated, the current numbering is not supposed to indicate priorities or a sequence in which they will be achieved.

* Many subnets: Latency of 90% of the inter-canister messages on 1000 subnets with a "typical" workload distribution is below 5s
* Large subnets: Subnets with 200 nodes achieve a block rate of 1/s
* Resilience: No bad peer can deteriorate the throughput and latency by more than 5% in and across subnets of at least 50 nodes
* Large messages: Update and query requests of up to 10GB are supported


## Why the DFINITY Foundation should make this a long-running R&D project

To support the projected growth and adoption rate with an outstanding development and user experience, the Internet Computer must be enabled to scale out and adapt to its workload automatically while preserving its security guarantees. Therefore, the DFINITY Foundation is committed to investigating and designing the next generation of the IC protocol by solving the above-mentioned problems, so the IC can cope with very high loads and tolerate Byzantine nodes.

## Skills and Expertise necessary to accomplish this

Tackling the challenges mentioned above relies on research and development efforts in many components and requires a diverse set of engineers and researchers with expertise in Distributed Systems, Cryptography, Performance Analysis and Management, Operating Systems, and Networking and is expected to take multiple years.

## 9. Open Research questions

* How can overlays for the communication between and within subnets of different sizes be constructed and used efficiently?
* How can the management of node and subnet configuration and keys be distributed among multiple canisters?
* How can a node (re)joining a subnet discover its current overlay peers and obtain the necessary information to participate in the protocol quickly?
* How do subnets discover which other subnets have canister messages for them and how do they schedule their nodes to exchange them?
* How can the traffic be shaped to utilize the available bandwidth between nodes in the same and different data centers efficiently despite malicious nodes?
* How can one design OS and networking scheduling algorithms to provide Quality of service guarantees despite Byzantine players?
* How can large messages be partitioned, stored and disseminated efficiently on the different layers of the IC stack?
* How can one design speculative algorithms for the execution and verification of canister message processing?
* How can the dissemination of messages be separated from ordering them with minimal overhead?
* How can the Internet Computer be monitored and analysed in a distributed fashion?

## 10. Examples where community can integrate into project

Due to the wide scope of required expertise for this motion proposal, it is expected that it will be carried out in tight interaction with the community. In particular, it is planned to organise workshops as the motion proposal evolves to discuss priorities, solution approaches, and implementation. Furthermore, a critical assessment and discussion regarding the security and growth and usage assumptions is of strong interest.

* Vote accept or reject on NNS Motion

# Summary

This project aims to improve the support for dapps with high storage requirements on the Internet Computer.

# Background

Currently the Internet Computer has two types of subnet blockchains: system (with high replication) and application (with medium replication).

System subnets with high replication factor are necessary for platform crucial services like the NNS. They are costly to operate (lots of nodes are needed); slower to update (the finalisation rate is slower to accommodate the additional nodes); but offer very high security. Application subnets have medium replication so they are cheaper; faster to update; but have slightly lower security.

# Objective

As the Internet Computer evolves, it is possible to imagine other types of subnets that operate at different points on the design spectrum and have different trade offs between security vs. speed and cost.

This motion proposes that the DFINITY organisation invest engineering resources into researching and developing additional types of subnets. More concretely the motion proposes to explore the concept of storage subnets. The core feature of this subnet type will be:

* It uses node machines with higher storage capacity and
* It operates with fewer nodes (smaller replication factor) than other subnet types.

In order to realise this new subnet type, research into the following topics will be needed:

* Intra-subnet protocol improvements: to ensure that a subnet with a large state is operational.
* Inter-subnet protocol improvements: to ensure that a less secure subnet cannot impact the security and functionality of other subnets.
* Data integrity improvements: to ensure that data integrity is maintained with lower replication factor.

# Why this is important

At 5 USD / GiB / year, the Internet Computer today already has very competitive fees for storage. This feature will allow the IC to offer storage to dapps at even lower costs (albeit with potentially different semantics and guarantees). Lower storage costs will enable a new class of dapps on the IC that today are prohibitively expensive to run on the IC and help improve resilience of existing dapps by allowing them to store backups of their data.

Due to the lower replication factor, fewer nodes will be needed to provide the same amount of storage capacity on the IC. This means that for the same number of nodes, the IC will be offering a bigger storage capacity.

# Topics under this project

## Intra-subnet protocol improvements

The new storage subnets will have larger states. So additional improvements to the protocol and implementation will be needed to ensure that the large states are properly handled. One obvious component that will have to be improved is state synchronization. This component is responsible for allowing new nodes or slow nodes to catch up with the latest state. Improvements will be needed to ensure that nodes can still catch up even with larger states.

## Inter-subnet protocol improvements

Due to the lower replication factor, the new subnet type might be easier to corrupt or to stall. Protocol improvements will be needed to ensure subnet isolation so that faults in one subnet cannot spread to other subnets.

## Data integrity improvements

A subnet with a lower replication factor can tolerate fewer corrupted nodes. Protocol improvements will be needed to ensure that as long as at least one honest node is available, data integrity will be guaranteed.


# Why the DFINITY Foundation should make this a long-running R&D project

This project will enable an important class of dapps on the IC. Additionally, a number of protocol and implementation improvements required to achieve the goals of this project will also be applicable to other parts of the IC and improve the IC in general.

# Skills and Expertise necessary to accomplish this (maybe teams?)

Due to the complexity of the initiative, a broad selection of skills as outlined next:

* System design

* System level software engineering

* Algorithms, complexity

* Probability theory

* Cryptography

* Deep understanding of Internet Computer consensus

* API design

At least the following teams are likely required:

* Research

* Networking

* Consensus

* Message Routing

* Execution

* Security

# Open Research questions

There can be multiple other mechanisms to achieve the desired goals of this project.

Another idea is to use erasure codes to split the data on multiple nodes. With this latter approach you could have a subnet with many nodes and high resilience, but where the total storage overhead is small (<2x). Communication is higher during storage and retrieval though (<2x) and the nodes that store data must compute the codewords. Also, search is not as easy, so it depends on whether data will be fully at rest. Also, if the nodes running the storage network change, you have to run an expensive recoding.

# Examples where community can integrate into project

As already mentioned before, in the initial phase of this motion input regarding refining the scope and priorities of this project from the community is highly appreciated. In addition many technical discussions with the community are anticipated as the motion and research and development of potential technical solutions to address the goals of this proposal move forward.

# Summary

The Internet Computer (IC) is a general platform to host applications processing all kinds of data and digital assets. For its architecture, protocol and growth, decentralisation has so far been a key concern. The latter includes being resilient against various forms of network-centric and distributed attacks. The following motion proposal aims to complement the security of the IC by focusing on the IC providing virtual machines and the associated host operating system.

To strengthen the security it is planned to compartmentalize the IC software and holistically secure the system. As a part of this process, a clearly defined and fine-grained security policy has to be devised to detect and prevent security breaches and in case the former cannot be achieved, for example due to a zero-day vulnerability, to limit the impact of a successful attack to a minimum. Furthermore, the proposal targets to implement measures for an early detection of such attacks and a rapid impact analysis to establish countermeasures such as updating the system.

# Objective

The two main objectives of this proposal are to reduce the attack surface and mitigate the effects of a successful attack at the IC node level. This will be achieved by compartmentalization of the IC software and establishing a fine-grained security policy thereby limiting and controlling access and execution privileges of all system actors. Based on the former a layered security architecture to improve the resilience of the IC at the virtual machine and the host operating system level will be established. In case of successful attacks support for an early detection needs to be provided to facilitate an instant root cause and impact analysis enabling to deploy countermeasures.

# Background

The system architecture of an IC node has been designed with a reduced attack surface in mind and represents a controlled and clearly structured environment. The IC protocol and all attached software has been implemented in Rust to offer a secure and very stable system. Nevertheless, as the IC matures the implemented security measures need to be amplified.

This requires further decomposition of the system in isolatable components with clearly defined interfaces. The achieved compartmentalization builds the basis of a mandatory access control and a fine-grained security policy. Together this forms the basis for a layered security or defense in depth where even in case of a successful attack the damage will be limited and can be better assessed. Furthermore an attacker can be slowed down and the likelihood of detecting and implementing counteractions rises.

# Why this is important

The growth of the IC and new features like canisters holding ICP and the integration with other digital currencies such as Ethereum will make the IC an attractive high value target for attacks. Despite the strong commitment of making the IC a secure and resilient infrastructure due to the complexity of the system, vulnerabilities might surface. To address them in the first place and contain their impact if necessary, this motion proposal sets out to strengthen the security at the node level and establish mechanisms for a fast incidence detection and response.

# Topics under this project

While compartmentalization of the IC system software and the establishment of a fine-grained mandatory access control is the initial overarching goal, a set of measures can be identified that will be applied at the virtual machine level and if applicable at the host operating system stage as well.

In a first step, all software including the operating system and otherwise static data will be made immutable via a read-only and integrity protected file system. This prevents unwanted modification to binaries, hinders the persistence of malicious code. Boot and upgrade integrity verification stops a successful intruder from installation of backdoored system images.

Subsequently, a fine-grained mandatory access control policy will be designed, extensively tested and finally deployed. This policy will not only restrict the software during normal operation but also restrict and control the access of administrative personnel in case of maintenance and incident response. Security policies will also ensure that operator access to nodes is fully auditable. This allows independent verification that operator intervention was performed in accordance with procedures.

While the [Sandboxing mechanism for canister WASM execution](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/security-sandboxing/7438/3) motion proposal already divides the IC core software by separating the execution of canister code from the main protocol logic, further compartmentalization steps will be explored as part of this proposal. Prime candidates to extend the already started process-based separation are functionalities related to code generation, components facing the public network and cryptographic operations. Initially, a detailed security analysis as well as performance impact study will be performed, thereby rating the individual compartmentalization scenarios. The candidates with the best security and acceptable performance trade-off will be implemented, tested, and deployed.

Beside these steps, to increase the protection of the IC, a number of measures to respond to incidents need to be established. In particular the proposal will devise mechanisms providing the basis for a controlled and privacy-preserving monitoring of IC nodes. It is important to offer detailed monitoring data to facilitate an early detection of security-related issues, while preventing the exposure of sensitive information as part of the monitoring data. In case of successful attacks a root cause and impact analysis needs to be performed. It is planned to develop tool support for guiding these measures.

# Key milestones

This motion proposal targets a long-term perspective and as such is planned for three years. Parts of it will be detailed and refined as the work progresses. At this stage six milestones are planned:

* M1: Read-only, integrity protected root file system
* M2: Initial security policy for the IC virtual machines
* M2: Initial security policy for the IC host operating system
* M3: Methodology for a semi-automated validation of performed partitioning of the IC core software
* M4: Extended partitioning of the IC core software
* M5: Methodology for a semi-automated approach enabling to adapt and validate the security policies of the IC virtual machine and host operating system
* M6: Methodology and tools for extensive but privacy-preserving logging, incident root cause analysis as well as impact assessment of successful attacks

# Discussion leads

As members of the DFINITY research team Helge Bahmann and Rüdiger Kapitza will drive the proposal and are available for discussion.

# Why the DFINITY Foundation should make this a long-running R&D project

In general securing systems is an ongoing topic as new forms of attacks are discovered and large distributed systems are constantly being attacked. The proposed set of measures touches almost all parts of the system and the envisioned changes have to be performed with great care. For the next up to three years the main research and engineering work will be carried out but the performed compartmentalization and the designed security policies have to be constantly revised as the system evolves. Ensuring security as such is a long-term commitment.

# Skills and Expertise necessary to accomplish this

The initial driver of this proposal will be the node team for them DFINITY Foundation in close interaction with the execution and the security team. However, as security is a cross-cutting concern, all teams that design and implement functionality executed on the IC will at some point be involved in this proposal.

As compartmentalization and policies are established this requires extensive tests to ensure that the policies do not hinder required functionality but also are not too relaxed.

Expertise-wise the proposal requires researchers and engineers with strong background in operating and systems security as well as for the partitioning of the IC core software a deep understanding of software architecture and system design. As indicated by the outlined research questions for the envisioned semi-automated policy adaptation researchers from the fields of formal methods, testing and software engineering are key.

# Open Research questions

While the starting point of this proposal is to decompose the software on an IC node in multiple compartments and establish a fine-grained security policy for mandatory access control, the research questions root in the rapid evolution of the IC software and the Rust-based IC core software. In particular the aim is to answer the following questions:

* How can a fine-grained security policy be safely adapted in a rapidly evolving software ecosystem? The aim is to establish a semi-automated approach for validation of adaptation steps.
* How to enable an at least semi-automated validation of a partitioning of the IC core code?
* How to ensure an extensive but privacy-preserving logging that can be validated?
* How to not only detect a security breach but also perform an automated impact analysis that can be used to establish counter measures?

# Examples where community can integrate into project

Since the proposal is developed in the open the community can and should cross-check the compartmentalization and associate policies in order to validate the security of the IC. The community has also the potential to act as an early warning system for new forms of attacks and possible vulnerabilities of the IC.

# What we are asking the community

The security of the IC is an essential property that needs to be constantly strengthened and adapted. This proposal aims to make a strong contribution to this effort. We welcome comments, questions and feedback and hope for a positive vote on the proposal.




 

Here is the text of this motion proposal, thus far:

# Tokenomics Project Proposal

## 1. Objective

Evolve Tokenomics on the Internet Computer to best incentivize participation, both for those locking up their tokens to participate in voting activities, and those who will use tokens to purchase cycles and/or support various market activities.

## 2. Background

On May 10, 2021, the Internet Computer was launched, along with a ledger and governance system (NNS), and ICP tokens were brought to life.

With the launch of these two principle canisters: the ledger and the NNS: a series of choices were made concerning lock up, voting rewards, how and when minting can happen, initial supply, etc., all of which have an impact on the overall economy of the Internet Computer.

## 3. Why this is important

Every free market consists of multiple economic pressures, many of which cannot be predicted ahead of time, especially when novel influences are present. At the launch of the Internet Computer, certain factors were decided on as representing the best start to launch the network and begin inviting participation.

Over time, the community has gained valuable information as to inflation and burn rates, popularity of staking, accumulation of fees, open market valuation, etc. It becomes important, then, to re-assess the original choices in light of these factors, to determine whether adjustments should be made to further incentivize participation. In short, the tokenomics describe a dynamic system with multiple gauges for the community to observe and levers for the community to pull.

## 4. Topics under this project

While not an exhaustive list, the Tokenomics project will consider many topics, including the following:

* Adaptive inflation and deflation control;
* Remuneration parameter changes (node providers, neuron rewards, …);
* Modeling of the ICP market and its movements, to better assess the impact of future changes to the tokenomics;
* Staking forms and neuron reward parameters and management functionality;
* Proposals, voting and reward modeling and tuning.

In brief, the Foundation wants to help the community to create a clear and transparent view as to what all the existing parameters are; their real-world impact on market data; and a clearer understanding as to how future proposals may alter that impact positively or negatively. For example, if reward rates are increased for short-term stakers, or if rewards are allowed for neurons with less than six months remaining dissolve delay, would this be likely to increase the percentage of staked supply? Would it lead to more neurons being created?

## 5. Key milestones (and technical solution if known)

Some of the key milestones for this project include:

* Improve documentation, terminology and educational materials, in order to facilitate a clear and broad understanding of how the tokenomics for the IC works, what led to the current choice of parameters, and what aspects are likely to need tuning in the future. This also requires increasing transparency and allowing participants to better understand the flow of supply and how past choices may have affected future outcomes.
* Develop economic models that can offer insight into the possible outcomes of parameter changes.
* Define measurable objectives for our tokenomics with respect to inflation, amount of liquid supply, staking participation, and market volume. This creates a baseline against which we can measure the health of our current tokenomics.
* Create a series of motion proposals, based on community interaction and findings from the above, to fine-tune the tokenomics until we reach the desired goals of utility and equilibrium.
* Mechanisms to help regulate the liquidity and supply of ICP, new staking options and other economic instruments that allow the Internet Computer to offer a thriving market for all participants.

## 6. Discussion leads

John Wiegley, Johan Granstrom, Lara Schmid, Igor Lilic, Timo Hanke 

## 7. Why the DFINITY Foundation should make this a long-running R&D project

This should be a long-running project because tokenomics is the beating heart of the Internet Computer economy. If we overheat and supply increases too quickly, it can cause a depression in price that scares away investors; or if we freeze up and exhaust supply, it could lead to low volumes and high volatility that are unattractive to businesses seeking to stockpile ICP for their computing needs. The right balance of supply, engagement and volume, will lead to a healthy economy that works well for its participants, and not only for long and short speculators.

## 8. Skills and Expertise necessary to accomplish this (maybe teams?)

Some background in finance and economics is necessary, as well as a technical understanding of decentralized markets and how canisters like the Ledger and NNS are used to create such a market. There are many variables at play in this highly dynamic system, so insight into the long-term impact of economic decisions becomes critical to making well-timed decisions. This is a project that will likely have a lot of community participation.

## 9. Open Research questions

* How best to model and forecast the economic parameters specific to the Internet Computer remains an open question.
* With respect to ledger behavior and the operation of token markets, we can look to existing projects for guidance and inspiration.
* Explore existing and analogous financial structures (options, futures, CFDs, bonds, etc), DeFi opportunities, and smart contract mechanisms to best support the economy and ecosystem of the Internet Computer.
* For each structure created and employed at the level of the NNS, how can it best be offered to communities on the Internet Computer, in order to help build community economies in an adaptable way?

## 10. Examples where community can integrate into project

Discussions on the DFINITY Forum is probably the best place to begin integrating into this project, as well as open source projects for any modeling systems that are created to aid with analysis.

## 11. What we are asking the community

Please submit your questions, experiences, concerns, frustrations, hopes and fears, since it is the decisions of the market population that ultimately determine whether a Tokenomics proposal will succeed or not.

* Review comments, ask questions, give feedback

* Vote accept or reject on NNS Motion

## 1. Objective

Our SDK mission is to make IC smart contract tooling intuitive to use and flexible enough for any use case. For beginners, we want to cut down on the mental overhead. For intermediate developers, we want to add improved debugging tools and profiling. And for advanced developers, we want to offer rigorous tooling that will offer greater visibility to the low-level operations and memory management of a canister.

## 2. Background

Currently, the SDK team oversees several tools that allow developers to develop and interact with Internet Computer canisters. Those tools include the main SDK repo, the Rust Canister Development Kit (CDK), the Rust agent, and the JavaScript agent.

## 3. Why this is important

The IC has a great deal of complexity, and engineers from Web2 and other blockchain contexts have high expectations for the quality of their developer experience. For the IC to become the world computer, and attract talented developers at all levels of experience, we need to provide world-class tooling.

## 4. Topics under this project

* Documentation
* Improvements to debugging & profiling
* Safe Upgrades and Backups

## 5. Key milestones (and technical solution if known)

Beginner-friendly features

Someone getting started on the platform has a lot of mental overhead, and we want to accommodate them by reducing the amount of Internet Computer context that someone needs to understand to get started. To that end, we have:

* Expand the number of project templates we offer to include popular frontend frameworks and options that come with things like CRUD, authentication, and asset management
* Simplify DFX, particularly around the Cycles Wallet and cache management
* Provide tutorials for common use-cases
  * NFTs
  * Tokens / ledgers
  * DeFi and payments

Intermediate Developer Features

For intermediate developers, we want to improve the quality of the development workflow, with a particular focus on developer tooling and safe, reproducible upgrades to live canisters. That will include:

  * Support for app push notifications
  * WebDAV or FS-UI support for asset canisters
  * Asset streaming through the serviceworker
  * New asset upload npm package
  * Overall improvements to managing large amounts of data on the IC

## 6. Discussion leads

Kyle Peacock

## 7. Why the DFINITY Foundation should make this a long-running R&D project

Tools under the SDK mandate are critical both to the internal and external stakeholders. Improved tooling makes it easier to discover and patch security issues on Canisters, to improve performance, and allow for safe upgrades and migration of data.

## 8. Skills and Expertise necessary to accomplish this (maybe teams?)

We have openings for experienced engineers with backgrounds in tooling, distributed systems, and anyone with solid experience in Rust.

## 9. Open Research questions

We have not settled on the best approach to run a local execution environment that supports multiple Operating Systems, debugging, and canister profiling.

# Motoko 

## 1. Objective

The objective of this proposal is to gain community approval on plans to extend and maintain Motoko as an attractive and feasible option for canister smart contract development on the IC.

## 2. Background

Motoko was conceived at a time when language options for development on the IC were few and had very sharp edges. While launching a new language is fraught with risk, it was felt that the available languages and compilers targeting WebAssembly were either too unsafe or too impractical, forgoing memory safety or requiring manual construction of asynchronous code. The situation has improved and Rust is now a viable option, but Motoko arguably still provides the least friction and most safety when authoring IC canisters.

Nevertheless, the challenges of supporting a new language and ecosystem are considerable, requiring heavy investment in:

* Compiler technology

* Runtime system (e.g. robust and scalable memory management, serialization etc.)

* Libraries

* Tooling (e.g. IDE support, debuggers, profilers, you name them)

* Documentation

## 3. Why this is important

The adoption of any new technology, including the IC, requires an easy on-ramp. Technology that is hard to use will struggle to thrive.

Motoko, with its relative ease of use and static enforcement of IC constraints provides a gentle introduction to the IC. However, in order to scale to industrial applications, Motoko and its toolchain will require significant research and development to deliver increased performance, scalability and productivity.

## 4. Topics under this project

Development of Motoko and its toolchain is a broad endeavour, covering both research and engineering. Our roadmap includes some of the commitments listed below.

Our ability to adhere to these mid- and long-term commitments will depend on resourcing and other developments. These commitment include:

* Improved scalability of the garbage collector, most likely by adopting an incremental, generational collector.

* Gaining and maintaining parity with newer IC features such as heartbeat messages and the new 128bit cycles API.

* Improved scalability of stable variable serialization including reduced memory consumption and improved robustness (e.g. to stack overflow).

* Opt-in, direct access to stable memory for scenarios unsuited to stable variables.

* Language enhancements, such as better abstraction facilities for asynchronous code, generics with shared type, error propagation syntax, object composition/modification syntax, and other quality-of-life improvements.

* Tooling improvements: more flexible package management, enhanced IDE support.

Improved logging and debugging support when and as supported by the IC.

* Library development, expanding existing libraries (e.g. Iter.mo, Char.mo) and adding new ones (e.g. Time.mo)

## 5. Key milestones

* Scalability: Provide access to most of 4GB Wasm memory for heap and large stable variable data, without compromising ability to upgrade.

* Language: Support efficient and safe abstraction of asynchronous code.

* Parity: Expose all (reasonable) IC System APIs in suitable safe and natural abstractions.

* Ecosystem: Offer a wide selection of commonly requested libraries.

## 6. Discussion Leads

Andreas Rossberg and Claudio Russo

## 7. Why the DFINITY Foundation should make this a long-running R&D project

Motoko showcases the facilities of the IC and Candid in a coherent, seamless design unobscured by the library or macro-based encodings required to integrate third party languages.

Although not the only choice of language, most external projects to date have chosen Motoko as their development language. The Foundation has an interest and a responsibility to maintain and grow the value of these external investments.

## 8. Skills and Expertise necessary to accomplish this

Type theory, concurrency theory, language design and implementation (compilation), memory management/garbage collection, documentation, library design.

## 9. Open Research questions

* The cost model of the IC is more abstract than typical hardware. Traditional compilers optimize for speed, or, occasionally code and memory size. Optimizing

for IC cycle consumption and Wasm page use requires atypical design choices.

* The IC is a distributed computing system using asynchronous communication. The actor model in Motoko  addresses some of the challenges of programming such a system, but still lacks good support for ensuring concurrency correctness, abstracting over asynchronous code, distributed transactions and other forms of actor coordination all of which are open research questions.

* The IC currently provides a traditional form of access control based on caller identity, a simple form of stack inspection. This approach has known limitations which others have proposed are better addressed by capability based systems. Adding capabilities based security to both the IC and Motoko is an open, long-term research problem.

* Multi-canister upgrade. Motoko supports actor classes, allowing programmatic installation of networks of actors, but (like the IC in general) has no good support for how to programmatically and safely upgrade installed instances.

## 10. Examples where community can integrate into project

Motoko and its tooling are developed in the open. We welcome and encourage feedback, suggestions and contributions from the community, particularly in the development of libraries which are sorely needed. Notable examples include a fully-fledged `Time` library and various cryptographic libraries normally expected on blockchain platforms.

Similarly, documentation is an open-ended project, and contributions from the community, e.g., tutorials, could help to improve the discoverability and understandability of Motoko features and its integration with the platform.

## 11. What we are asking the community

* Review comments, ask questions, give feedback

* Vote accept or reject on NNS Motion

### Post-quantum security

**Objective:** Make the IC secure against quantum-capable attackers.

**Discussion leads:** Jens Groth, Andrea Cerulli

**Background**: In the future attackers may be aided by quantum computers. Quantum algorithms can break some of the cryptographic assumptions the Internet Computer relies on, specifically the hardness of computing discrete logarithms. A quantum-capable adversary could thus forge signatures used in the IC. Predictions of when quantum computers will be powerful enough to break the discrete logarithm problem vary, with a [small minority of experts](https://globalriskinstitute.org/publications/quantum-threat-timeline-report-2020/) believing it could be within the next 5 years. Hardening the IC against quantum-capable adversaries is a significant effort and already now attackers are known to harvest ciphertexts to later be decrypted with quantum computers, so it makes sense to start early on making the IC post-quantum secure.

**Open research questions, topics and key milestones**:

* Determine versatility, efficiency and cryptanalytic resilience of primitives to be believed to be post-quantum secure and select appropriate security parameters. Existing symmetric key primitives such as AES and SHA are believed to be post-quantum secure. For public-key encryption the current front-runner is lattice-based cryptography. For signatures there are both lattice-based and hash-based candidates, however, lattice-based signatures may be more versatile in building more sophisticated signatures e.g. threshold signatures
* Evaluate the quantum computing landscape annually and continuously monitor the cryptanalytic landscape to inform choices of primitives we rely on and determine appropriate security parameters
* Invent appropriate post-quantum schemes, when there is no existing solution. Some of the schemes in the IC are non-trivial to translate to the post-quantum world, e.g., threshold relay or non-interactive DKG. An alternative when no such scheme exists is to modify the IC protocol so that it relies on a different type of cryptographic scheme.
* Prove all schemes are secure under appropriate cryptographic assumptions. There are pitfalls to avoid here, a common mistake is to assume a cryptographic scheme is secure as long as it is based on post-quantum secure primitives. This is not always the case, so the IC must rely on schemes that have security reductions testifying to post-quantum robustness. There are also schemes where classical definitions of security fail, the classical binding property of commitment schemes does for instance not suffice against quantum-capable attackers.
* Develop, implement and deploy alternatives to the current cryptographic suite. Some of the schemes the IC uses are already believed to be post-quantum secure or [likely to be provided by the cryptographic community](https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/post-quantum-cryptography/post-quantum-cryptography-standardization), e.g., hash functions and TLS. Others, such as the multi-signatures and threshold signatures are likely to require new implementations
* Work with the community to specify requirements for post-quantum security on the user side. How to provide PQ-safe wallets, user authentication, libraries to verify PQ-safe communication from the IC.
* Transition to post-quantum security: how to protect dormant users with staked ICP, how to protect confidentiality of encrypted data, assess whether quantum computers will come as an evolution or a revolution, and how to prepare for the latter scenario

**Skills and expertise:** Cryptographers versed in post-quantum cryptography, with lattice-based cryptography as the current front runner. The Research Team and the Crypto Library team will work jointly on the initiatives.

**How to work with the community:** On the research side, the project is suitable for collaboration with researchers in and outside of academia. The developer community can contribute to the creation of tools that make canister smart contracts post-quantum secure. Community discussions can guide the requirements for post-quantum security and settle on standards and best practices for the IC.

**What we are asking the community:**

* Review comments, ask questions, give feedback
* Vote accept or reject on NNS Motion
* Participate in technical discussions as the motion moves forward

# Internet Identity features (One-pager)

## Summary

Internet Identity is a blockchain authentication system built for and on the Internet Computer. Internet Identity enables users to authenticate toward each dapp with a pseudonymous identity, which is consistent across multiple user devices but unlinkable across different dapps. Internet Identity has been launched together with the Internet Computer, and is used by many users of the Internet Computer to authenticate toward their favorite dapps.

While Internet Identity as it is today already provides secure authentication and works seamlessly across multiple user devices – building on both web authentication (for secure key storage on client devices) and on the threshold cryptography of the IC (for supporting multiple ones) – several key features can still be improved. This motion suggests focusing R&D efforts in the following years to the following topics:

* Improve security of recovery method management in the II canister.
* Provide stronger, cryptographic unlinkability guarantees with weaker trust assumptions.
* Performance improvement in generating delegations.
* Secure account recovery using external identity verification providers.
* Decentralized anonymous credential-based authentication.
* Better mechanisms against bots, e.g. based on web auth attestations.
* Support for devices without web authentication.
* Support Internet Identity use in native apps.

## Background

The core component of Internet Identity is a canister that manages the mapping between a identity anchor of a user and the public keys associated with the devices of the user. More technically, the users authenticates toward the canister from their devices, and upon successful authentications, the canister issues delegations with which the users can authenticate themselves toward dapps.

The Internet Identity canister also serves the Internet Identity front end into the browsers used by users. The front end is a light, Javascript-based application that manages the identity anchor of a user in the canister and that builds on web authentication as a mechanism for storing the cryptographic keys of users in secure hardware. The front end also interacts with dapps that support Internet Identity for authenticating their users.

## Topics

### Secure management of recovery methods and keys

Currently, all devices and recovery methods associated with an identity anchor of a user have the same level of privileges. In particular, each device or recovery method can be used to delete or add any other device or recovery methods. This does not allow for reflecting the actual security properties of different devices, such as a USB security key that can be activated by a simple touch, a key stored on a phone or laptop that requires the user to authenticate via biometrics for each use, or a seed phrase stored in a secure locker. In the future, Internet Identity shall support different privilege levels for different devices, allowing a user to designate certain devices or recovery methods as more trusted and, e.g., make them non-deletable by lower-level devices and methods.

### Cryptographic unlinkability under weaker assumptions

The unlinkability of pseudonyms that are related to the same identity anchor but issued for different dapps currently depends on the secrecy of a seed stored within the Internet Identity canister. (No other security property is affected.) A better method of storing such a seed would be in a threshold secret-sharing across all nodes of the subnet running the Internet Identity canister, since then no small subset of nodes can reconstruct the secret. It is proposed to develop new cryptographic protocols for the secure derivation of unlinkable pseudonyms based on threshold cryptography.

### Performance improvement in generating delegations

The delegations that the Internet Identity canister issues toward dapp front ends (and that allow the user to always authenticate under the same pseudonym for that dapp) are authenticated via the certified variables mechanism of the IC. Certifications of variables require finalization on the block containing the request, which leads to a noticeable delay in creating the delegation. In the future, and in line with the previous topic on securely deriving unlinkable pseudonyms, the Internet Computer shall be able to issue the delegations without the need for finalization in consensus.

### Secure account recovery based on external identity providers

Internet Identity provides two recovery mechanisms: additional (e.g. USB) security devices – which require additional expenses – and recovery phrases – which are difficult to manage securely for most users. In the future, Internet Identity shall provide an additional recovery method in which users associate (in encrypted form) personal information with their identity anchor, and designate specific identity verification services for recovering access to the account, based on validation of documents proving the associated personal information.

### Decentralized anonymous credential-based authentication

Authentication of users on the Internet Computer is based on their principal, which serves as a pseudonym for the user. The Internet Identity does not yet support additional attributes such as age, citizenship, residence, bonus program membership, and so forth. In the future, Internet Identity shall support a self-sovereign and privacy-friendly implementation of attribute-based authentication based on anonymous credentials.

### Improve protection from bots

The current implementation of Internet Identity uses proofs of work to protect from bots, which have been proven insufficient and will soon be amended by a CAPTCHA. Yet, also the CAPTCHA-based protection may be insufficient as a protection from bots at some point in time. An additional measure can be based on web authentication attestations, which attest the device used for the registration, and thereby require the involvement of a person. In the future, this and similar mechanisms shall be scrutinized and implemented.

### Support for devices without web authentication

The current implementation of the Internet Identity front end requires web authentication to be supported by the device of a user. Various users have devices that do not support web authentication, which they would still like to use to access the Internet Computer. In the future, Internet Identity shall improve support for such cases, with possible directions including delegated authorization from a web-authentication-enabled device, or software-based solutions if they can provide a similar level of security.

### Support for Internet Identity in native apps

Internet Identity was designed primarily with focus on web-browser-based front ends served from dapp canisters, and it is difficult to integrate with native applications (e.g. installed on the user’s phone). In the future, Internet Identity shall provide better interoperability with such native applications.

### Privacy: Multi-party computation

**Background**: Since computation is replicated on many nodes, users risk one of the nodes leaking information. Cryptographic protocols for multi-party computation enable several nodes to jointly compute a function on confidential data without revealing the input or intermediate data. In theory, any function can be securely evaluated with MPC but users pay a significant performance overhead. This research will provide MPC functionality on the IC for users who need strong privacy guarantees.

**Objective:** Deploy multi-party computation techniques to enable computation on private data

**Discussion leads:** Victor Shoup, Jens Groth

**Research questions:**

* How can users submit confidential data? Are there optimizations in bulk submission?
* Are there distributed backup mechanisms that enable an MPC protocol to hold long-term confidential state at reasonable cost?
* What is the best way to integrate MPC functionality and the rest of the IC?
* Which language should developers use to specify their MPC functionality, and how can such a specification be realized with general purpose MPC protocols?
* Can high importance tasks, e.g. key management, be solved efficiently with special purpose MPC?
* How can developers specify certain data to be confidential and how will the interaction with public data work? How can users verify an MPC protocol will keep data confidential?
* Are there additional features, e.g., differential privacy that can complement MPC functionality?
* Do the MPC protocols offer post-quantum confidentiality? (see post-quantum initiative)

**Related work and initiatives:** The IC already uses a few MPC protocols, e.g., threshold BLS signatures. As part of Bitcoin integration, the Foundation has developed a threshold ECDSA signing protocol. Functionality used in the threshold ECDSA protocol could be used more broadly to do MPC relating to cryptographic operations in cyclic groups. The [Security Proofs](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/long-term-r-d-security-proofs-proposal/9398) and [Post-Quantum Security](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/long-term-r-d-pq-security-proposal/9395) initiatives are also closely aligned.

**Expertise and skills:** Cryptography to construct MPC protocols and prove they are secure, PL for domain specific MPC-friendly languages, perhaps Coding Theory for storage solutions. The Research team (chain key technology, formal security), Crypto Library team, and Consensus team will be among the contributors.

**How the community can contribute:** The project is suitable for collaboration with researchers in academia and elsewhere to find solutions to the research questions. Community input will be helpful on e.g. which type of confidential data are more common and the confidentiality requirements for processing them, e.g., GDPR compliance concerns.

* Vote accept or reject on NNS Motion
* Participate in technical discussions as the motion moves forward

# Objective

Use formal verification techniques to increase the confidence that the Internet Computer is secure and behaves as expected.


# Summary

The Internet Computer (IC) provides a secure environment for the canister smart contracts executing on it. But like any software stack, the IC can contain bugs, even with best practices such as testing and code reviews. Bugs can directly compromise the security of canisters, making the canisters unavailable, or losing or corrupting the data of canisters, e.g., changing the balances in the ledger canister. The open, permissionless nature of the IC means that such bugs can be triggered not only spontaneously, but also exploited by malicious actors. While disaster recovery procedures help fix such problems, they take time and may be insufficient in many cases, for example, if an attacker manages to steal ICP utility tokens or create them out of thin air. Formal verification dramatically reduces the risk of bugs in a system, including security vulnerabilities.

# Background

Formal verification is a general technique to improve the quality of software systems. It does this by specifying the desired system properties, and proving that a model of the system satisfies these properties. The specification and the satisfaction proof are done using rigorous mathematical techniques that are mechanized in software (so-called formal methods). The mathematical rigor ensures that the specification is unambiguous, and that the proof has no gaps.

Note that the risk of a bug or a vulnerability is not completely eliminated even with formal verification. For example, one could forget to include some desired properties in the specification. Also, the model could diverge from the actual system: for example, a model using (unbounded) natural numbers may miss arithmetic overflow problems that appear in a real system that uses 32-bit integers. However, by carefully defining the system model and the desired properties, the risk of undetected bugs is reduced considerably.

Within DFINITY, we have already successfully applied formal methods in small projects, finding bugs in critical parts of the stack that were missed in manual reviews and tests.

# Open Research Questions

Ideally, we would like to formally verify the entire IC stack. But formal verification is a slow and complex process, requiring expert input. Thus, we propose to start our verification effort by targeting some of the most critical components and mechanisms of the IC, such as:

* The canisters comprising the Network Nervous System (NNS) and the upcoming Service Nervous Systems (SNS)
* The subnet-based sharding mechanism implementation of the interface specification
* The split of replicas into layers (peer-to-peer, consensus, message routing, and execution), including the interface contracts of the layers
* The consensus algorithm and its implementation
* The message routing layer, including the state manager

As part of our research, we will weigh the probability and impact of bugs against the verification effort for each target, and prioritize and limit our efforts accordingly. This ratio will also depend on the verification technique applied, where different techniques might be more suitable for the different targets. The different techniques offer different trade-offs (in particular, the proximity of the system model to the source code versus verification effort), and may include:

* Static analysis, techniques for automatically verifying a fixed set of properties of source code
* Model checking, an automated technique to verify an abstract, simplified model of a target
* Automated test generation, a technique to derive tests for an implementation. This could be guided by an abstract model of the target (model-based testing), or by partial symbolic execution of the target code (concolic testing)
* Automated deductive verification, techniques for proving properties of the code of the target
* Interactive theorem proving, a general technique for mechanizing proofs of mathematical theorems

We will evaluate the state-of-the art techniques and their applicability to our targets. Applying them may require us to develop novel verification methodologies.

# Skills and Expertise

Formal methods expertise in different areas will be needed. The exact areas will depend on the verification tools and techniques we choose to apply, but also the verification targets we choose to pursue (e.g., we may require expertise in code verification, verification of distributed systems, or verification of security protocols). Within DFINITY, the work will largely be done by the members of the Formal Security team.

# Community Involvement

The research questions can be answered in collaboration with experts in academia and elsewhere. Any tooling developed for canister analysis could also be useful by other developers on the Internet Computer, to help analyze their own canisters. For example, a possible outcome of a verification project could be an annotation language to specify properties of canister methods, together with command-line tools for analysis, or even integration with an IDE. The development of such tools would present an opportunity for the community to get involved, helping prioritize the features of the tools and providing user feedback.

# Motion Proposal for Security Proofs

## 1. Objective

Prove the security of core cryptographic components of the IC, and create a security model and proof showing how the IC combines these components to provide well-defined security guarantees.

## 2. Background

The Internet Computer is a complex beast that requires several non-standard cryptographic primitives to come together in order to provide its strong security guarantees. Provable security, also known as reductionist security, is a technique from theoretical cryptography where a new scheme, protocol, or system is mathematically proved to be secure as long as some precisely stated hardness assumptions hold. The Foundation already used this technique to validate some of our core cryptographic components, such as the [non-interactive distributed key generation](https://eprint.iacr.org/2021/339) that is at the basis of our Key Chain technology, [threshold ECDSA](https://eprint.iacr.org/2021/1330) that underlies Bitcoin integration on the IC, or our [consensus protocol](https://eprint.iacr.org/2021/632).

## 3. Why this is important

Provable security is the main scientific design technique in modern cryptography and has become a requirement in the selection of many practical schemes and standards. Published security proofs will enable the community to analyze the protocol in all its details and verify its security. At the same time, they also allow us to make extra sure that the protocol does not have any hidden flaws.

## 4. Topics under this project

In a first phase, the Foundation will extend this approach to a number of other core components, e.g., the tree hash scheme that is used to hash the replicated state, the streaming signature scheme that secures cross-subnet communication, our gossip protocol, or the Internet Identity system.

In a second phase, the Foundation will validate the way these pieces are glued together to build more complex features (e.g., state synchronization, multi-subnet execution, disaster recovery) and, in the end, the full Internet Computer.

Correctly modeling security is a big part of the challenge here. One has to design models that cover the different aspects of security (integrity/safety, availability/liveness, as well as confidentiality/privacy) and that are simple enough for humans to get their heads wrapped around writing and verifying security proofs, yet are expressive enough to provide meaningful security guarantees in the real world. Because there are so many subcomponents and moving parts to the IC, most likely using a composable proof framework, e.g., the Universal Composability framework, to manage the complexity.

During both phases, this activity will keep a close link with the [Formal Verification](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/long-term-r-d-formal-verification-proposal/9397) effort that investigates the use of automated tools such as model checkers and theorem provers to provide strong security guarantees. One can expect strong synergies to come up between both approaches, especially in those components where manual proofs become too complex for human beings.

## 5. Key milestones (and technical solution if known)

* Published security proofs of selected components, possibly including
  * tree hash algorithm
  * streaming signatures
  * Internet Identity
* Selection of provable security frameworks to model security of the IC and modularize its security proof
* Security model and proof of the Internet Computer

## 6. Discussion leads

Gregory Neven, Jens Groth

# 7. Why the DFINITY Foundation should make this a long-running R&D project

Creating security models and proofs is a time-consuming activity, even for small cryptographic components. A security proof for the complete Internet Computer is a very ambitious endeavor that would rank it among the most complex systems that have ever been analyzed using this technique. Automated security proofs will be used wherever possible, but reconciling (manual) computational proofs and (automatable) formal methods is still a nascent field of research.

# 8. Skills and Expertise necessary to accomplish this (maybe teams?)

Cryptographic protocol design and analysis

Provable security frameworks and techniques

Formal methods

Teams involved: Research team (formal security), Crypto, Consensus, Message Routing, Networking, Execution, Crypto Layer 2 - II

# 9. Open Research questions

* Are the core cryptographic components of the IC provably secure?
* What type of security guarantees can the IC provably provide (integrity, liveness, fairness,...) and under what assumptions?
* Are these guarantees just worst-case lower bounds, or can they also be used to estimate efficiency and security of the IC in more optimistic real-life scenarios?
* Which technique is better suited to analyze the security of a large cryptographic system like the IC, manual reductionist proof or automated formal methods? Can they be combined in a meaningful way?

# 10. Examples where community can integrate into project

Provide input as to which components the community considers most crucial to analyze first, and which aspects of security the community cares most about.

Peer reviewing of the security proofs before and after publication

# Malicious party security

## Objective

The internet computer is designed to run software in the form of canister smart contracts in a very secure and reliable fashion. In simple terms, it means that many replicas together form a subnet, and even if some of those replicas are malicious and misbehaving, the internet computer still guarantees two important properties:

* Liveness: the canister smart contracts on that subnet should still be available and process incoming messages
* Safety: the state of a canister only transitions according to the rules of the canister (i.e., tampering with a canister state is impossible, and in particular rolling back double spending attacks are impossible).

The internet computer protocol by design has a very simple argument that guarantees safety, which can be observed simply by receiving sufficiently many cryptographic signatures. Liveness however is harder to achieve in practice: if peers in the subnet are malicious, they can send a lot of useless messages, trying to waste the bandwidth or CPU of an honest replica.

## Why this is important

The IC should be able to withstand and defend against all sorts of adversarial and non-adversarial behavior that may affect its liveness, safetly, performance and/or fairness. In particular, the IC should cope with DoS and other attacks that aim to waste its resources.

Beyond spamming the network by sending invalid, incorrect, irrelevant (e.g. duplicate, expired) or explicitly unwanted artifacts, every behavior that is capable of wasting system resources like advertising and then withholding requested artifacts is considered a form of misbehavior.

## Background

There are many different ways in which a replica can misbehave. Some are relatively simple: if a node sends some signed artifacts that deviates from the protocol (no honest party would ever send such artifacts), then this node is clearly misbehaving and there exists evidence. Other types of misbehavior are much harder to act upon: if a node never sends any message, there is no hard evidence of misbehavior.

We can classify the types of misbehavior based on whether a node can deterministically detect and prove them to other nodes in the network. If certain malicious actions are not provable, the affected victims could still file a complaint and let the system punish the bad node or user if a threshold of (e.g. > n/3) has complained against the same node or user.

### Deterministically detectable misbehavior

This category of misbehavior is unequivocally detectable based on specific action or received artifact. 

Publicly blamable:
* Node sends an unrequested or invalid artifact/advert/request
* Node sends the same artifact twice
* Node withholds requested artifacts
* Node sends too many artifacts (e.g., state sync requests) per time unit

Publicly provable:
* Equivocating blocks
* Equivocating signatures
* DKG dealings from non-dealers


### Probabilistically detectable misbehavior

A node can only probabilistically infer a misbehavior by statistically analyzing communication patterns of a peer.

Publicly blamable:
* Node regularly responds to artifact requests late (but before timeout)
* Node sends too many errors to requests.

Publicly observable: 
* Node fails to produce blocks most of the time, i.e. the fraction of the blocks in the final chain is below a certain level

### Collectively detectable
Some adversarial communication patterns may only be detectable on an aggregate basis by multiple nodes.

Publicly blamable:
- Node selectively advertises some artifacts to some of the peers but not to others.

## Key milestones

1. Replicas temporarily disconnect from peers that send invalid artifacts
2. All data structures are of bounded size, and malicious peers cannot prevent an honest node from staying up-to-date on the blockchain and state of the subnet
3. Statistically deviating replicas can be identified by the protocol
4. Action is taken against provably misbehaving replicas, and such replicas may be permanently removed from the internet computer by the protocol
5. Action is taken against statistically deviating replicas, and such replicas may be permanently removed from the internet computer by the protocol
6. No bad peer can deteriorate the throughput and latency by more than 20% in and across subnets of at least 50 nodes


## Open Research questions

* What are relevant metrics for correct participation in the Internet Computer Protocol?
* What are suitable observation windows and what are the expected and tolerated deviations from aggregate metrics?
* How can the traffic be shaped to utilize the available bandwidth between nodes in the same and different data centers efficiently despite malicious nodes?
* How can one design OS and networking scheduling algorithms to provide Quality of service guarantees despite Byzantine players?
* How can we prove that the internet computer protocol is live while maintaining bounded data structures?

## Skills and expertise necessary to accomplish this

This project will require a wide range of different skills. One the one hand, this is a theoretical problem, and requires academic distributed systems and cryptography experts. On the other hand, it requires empirical testing, which includes testing how specific malicious behavior is handled, but also chaos engineering and fuzzing techniques.

## 1. Objective
The objective of this R&D motion proposal is to improve the initial people parties implementation that is currently being worked on and to be released shortly. Those improvements have the goal to, among other things, strengthen the personhood validation process, improve the decentralization of the implementation, extend the validation strategy based on validated participants from earlier rounds, and design a more scalable system.

## 2. Background
People parties are a proof of personhood (also referred to as proof of humanity) built on and for the Internet Computer. Each people party takes place at one specific point in time. Prior to that time, each prospective participant commits to a location that they will visit for the time of the party. At the beginning of the party, participants are assigned to small, random subgroups, and meet in a real-time audio / video call with other participants assigned to the same group. The video call, however, does not show the faces of participants; instead, participants show their surroundings, proving that they are at the place they committed to. As locations chosen by different participants must have a certain minimum distance, and no participant can be physically present at two locations simultaneously, the proof of personhood even guarantees the uniqueness of the validated persons.

## 3. Why this is important
The main purpose of people parties is democratization. Each validated participant can designate a neuron in the network nervous system that receives increased voting power; this improves the relative voting power of the "many" vs. the "heavy". It also provides additional voting rewards to all validated participants, which further motivates people to participate in the parties. The validated personhood also benefits the Internet Computer ecosystem more broadly: Open Internet Systems, which are dapps that are controlled by a decentralized governance system, will be able to benefit from the improved decentralization similarly to the Internet Computer itself. And any dapp will be able to use the validation information in order to, e.g., differentiate between bots and actual human users.

## 4. Topics under this project
* Improve the proof of personhood to be more inclusive, rely less on centralized components, and gradually increase hardness for keeping bots out.
* New verification strategy that uses information from prior rounds and, e.g., assigns more trust to already (and frequently) validated persons.
* Design scalable implementation by using multiple canisters running on different subnets of the Internet Computer to orchestrate the parties.

## 5. Key milestones (and technical solution if known)
It is currently too early to already provide the concrete milestones for the future R&D initiative. What can be said already now is that we will work on the improvement in an agile way with the goal of providing value through incremental releases of the functionalities we intend to research and implement. It is likely that we will have multiple milestones for each major functionality, following our usual R&D process.

## 6. Discussion leads
Björn Tackmann, Timo Hanke, Dieter Sommer 

## 7. Why the DFINITY Foundation should make this a long-running R&D project
There will be an incentive by attackers to make attempts of building bot systems that would succeed in the personhood proofs and benefit from this. Thus, we expect that validation mechanisms need to continuously improve in order to keep thwarting attacks. This will require a longer-running involvement of the Foundation in terms of research and development efforts in stronger personhood validation mechanisms. Also, new mechanisms will need to be tried out with the community for their practicability and usability.

In addition to the above mentioned challenges, already the basic agenda in this motion proposal will require a substantial amount of R&D activities, which further motivates that this be a long-running R&D motion proposal.

## 8. Skills and Expertise necessary to accomplish this (maybe teams?)
This R&D initiative requires teams with a broad set of skills including the following:
* Personhood validation
* Thinking like an attacker, anticipating likely next steps by attackers, assessing what attackers may be capable of based on existing and upcoming technology
* Secure system design
* Internet Computer scalability
* Formal security modeling
* Security proofs
* Reliable and resilient browser-based real-time peer-to-peer audio / video conferencing
* Asynchronous systems and communication protocols

## 9. Open Research questions
* Strengthened mechanisms for proving personhood
* New verification strategies based on verified participants in previous rounds
* Scalability of the canister-based backend to parties of massive size, e.g., by running canisters on multiple subnets
* More strongly decentralized architecture for people parties, avoiding centralized components that may be a single point of failure

## 10. Examples where community can integrate into project
* Design reviews
* Code reviews
* Ideas / research on strengthened mechanisms for proving personhood
* Code contributions
* Helping test the implementations: This is hard to do for the Foundation alone as larger tests before a GA may require party dry-runs with more people than the Foundation has employees. This is a point where support by the community may be crucial for moving forward.

## 11. What we are asking the community
* Review comments, ask questions, give feedback
* Vote accept or reject on NNS Motion

*For completeness, we decided to also publish the motion proposal that we plan to submit on Monday. It combines the first post in this thread the the extension posted earlier today.*

# Decentralized Node Management

## Summary

The Internet Computer (IC) is formed by standardized node machines. These machines are owned by independent node providers and installed within independent data centers. This motion proposal describes the technical and organizational advances required to guarantee a continued, sustainable network growth of the IC.

## 1. Objective

The objective is threefold

* **Decentralization:** empower node providers to setup, monitor and maintain nodes independently.
* **Scalability:** remove technical and operational bottlenecks that hinder the network to grow to millions of nodes.
* **Automation:** remove errors and speed-up repetitive tasks to lower risks and reduce resources required for the ever-growing IC network

## 2. Background

Compared with other blockchains, the IC has stronger requirements on the homogeneity of the node machines due to the fact that most of the resources of the machines are dedicated to perform useful work (e.g. executing smart contracts, participating in threshold cryptography) that needs to be performed by all nodes of a given subnet blockchain.

The IC is designed to host mass market applications completely on chain. Thus the state of canister smart contracts on the IC can be much larger than the state of smart contracts on other blockchains. The nodes also need significant network capacity for managing and synchronizing that state. To meet the requirements of extremely high availability and high throughput, the IC nodes are hosted in data centers (DCs). To achieve decentralization, the nodes are owned and the DCs are operated by independent parties. Moreover, the DCs are spread across the globe. Due to the need for homogeneity and capacity, the Internet Computer Association (ICA) defines the hardware to be used for node machines. The network is expected to grow to millions of nodes running from thousands of DCs in the coming years. As decentralization is key to the mission of the IC, many new, independent node providers (NPs) will be needed to support that growth. The current NP onboarding process, node deployment and management procedures are not ready to sustain this network growth mid- and long-term.

## 3. Why is this important?

A successful IC attracts thousands of developers who are continuously deploying millions of canister smart contracts. In order to sustain this growth, the number of nodes and subnets must steadily increase. However, this growth can only be sustained if the operational processes are further automated, ready to scale – all in a decentralized fashion.

## 4. Topics under this project

Specifically, this proposal includes the following research and development directions. The first topics are reasonably well scoped and work has started. The second set of topics is to be tackled mid- and long/term.

### Short-term

* **Autonomous node deployment and operation:** Empower node providers to install and maintain nodes without any support from the ICA.
* **Independent node provider registration:** New node providers shall be able to register directly in the NNS frontend dapp.They will be able to submit a proposal to become a new node provider, without the support of the ICA.
* **NNS-driven DC allocation:** Node providers can participate in an NNS-controlled mechanism to elect new data centers. This process shall incentivise the addition of new DCs that further decentralize the network of the IC. Furthermore, it balances inflationary and deflationary forces.
* **Availability of node hardware:** A new generation of ICA-specified node hardware is planned that shall guarantee global availability and provide a better choice between hardware providers. Furthermore, the next generation shall include the SEV-SNP technology to further improve the security of nodes.

### Mid- and Long-term

* **Decentralized monitoring**: Currently, the health of the nodes is measured by collecting and analysing logs and metrics on a third-party cluster. When deviating from the expected indicator values, the respective node providers and data centers are notified manually to fix the situation. In the next generation of the Internet Computer protocol, the monitoring tasks will be carried out by the nodes of the network themselves, in a fully automated fashion. To this end, the architecture and the protocol of the nodes and their components require extensions. In particular, it should be possible for any party to collect information on the health and contributions of any node without additional trust assumptions.

* **Decentralized backup:** To ensure that even in the presence of a deadly bug in the node software the content of subnets is not lost, a backup mechanism shall be implemented to collect the state and the messages sent to a subnet off-chain. Using disaster recovery, the state of the subnet can be re-generated. In order to do this in a decentralized manner, mechanisms trading off replay speed, memory complexity, and privacy concerns have to be devised. Furthermore, the backup mechanism must be integrated in the governance protocol, including the assignment of which nodes are responsible for the backup of which subnets and their monitoring.

* **Decentralized boundary nodes:** As elaborated in a separate motion proposal, boundary nodes will become fully NNS-managed and use the same update mechanisms and operating system as regular nodes. This will allow the inclusion of boundary nodes in the new node provider deployment process with slight variations in the configuration process.

* **Extended node remuneration:** The previous items will lead to refinements and improvements of the node remuneration process. Insights gained through the decentralized monitoring will allow automated adjustments to payments based on the performance of nodes, or rather the lack thereof. Backup services and boundary nodes will be new categories to be included in the remuneration process.

* **Automated node and data center allocation and rewards:** In a future version of the internet computer protocol a lot more tasks will be automated and executed by NNS canisters. In particular, the computation of how much rewards a node in a specific location should be granted, will be taking the current local costs for electricity, wages, regulations and risks into account and combine this with the measurements obtained from the decentralized monitoring infrastructure. The future versions of the NNS will be designed to reflect the dynamics of compute and storage demand and supply, integrate decentralization metrics and balance the amount of tokens in circulation.

* **Automated subnet creation and healing:** With a continuously increasing number of nodes and subnets, it will become untenable to manually propose removal of unhealthy nodes and addition of new ones. Instead, the NNS will be extended to propose and execute node replacements and subnet creation based on data collected through decentralized monitoring.

Note that work described in the Motion proposals on Trusted Execution environments, Secure OS, E2E Security, Malicious parties, Scalability and Tokenomics is required to be integrated into the release and operational processes to achieve these goals. We will not describe or discuss them here in detail though and suggest questions regarding them to be asked in the corresponding forum threads.

## 5. Key milestones

The following milestones are indicative and their scope may change as the work proceeds.

* **(M1) Decentralized node deployments:** This milestone subsumes the first short-term items and enables node providers to independently onboard and deploy their nodes.
* **(M2) Redeployment** of existing nodes using new deployment mechanism
* **(M3) NNS-managed DC allocation:** New DCs are selected by the NNS, possibly using an auction mechanism.
* **(M4) Operational maturity**, including decentralized backup services and monitoring
* **(M5) Metrics-based remuneration:** a refinement of the node provider remuneration process, taking the data collected through decentralized monitoring into account.
* **(M6) Automation:** this is less of a milestone but rather a continuous effort.

Note: Boundary node milestones are described in a separate motion proposal.

## 6. People involved

Discussion leads: Samuel Burri, Luis Mompo Handen, Yvonne-Anne Pignolet 

## 7. Why the DFINITY Foundation should make this a long-running R&D project

The design, implementation and rollout of an enhanced node management requires changes to many layers of the IC stack but also a close collaboration with various stakeholders, such as the node providers. While community members may have an excellent understanding of individual components or aspects, it is unlikely that the community will drive this change end-to-end without a major contribution of the DFINITY foundation. For that reason and given the importance of the topic for a sustainable network growth, the foundation is determined to make significant resource investments in this project.

## 8. Skills and Expertise necessary to accomplish this

The problems described above require the cooperation of hardware, data center, and networking experts as well as software engineers, to design, review, and implement the prospective solutions. Specifically, experts from the following fields are necessary:

* Server design and configuration
* Networked systems
* Network management
* Network security
* Distributed systems
* Economics

This project would require both researchers and software engineers with expertise in the above-mentioned fields.

## 9. Open research questions

* What are the relevant metrics to derive information about the health and correct operation of nodes? How can this information be collected reliably in a trustless fashion despite failures?
* How should subnet backup information be distributed, stored and retrieved from nodes while respecting privacy and guaranteeing efficient recovery despite Byzantine node faults?
* How should the rewards for boundary nodes and backup nodes be determined in relationship to replica nodes? Should there be a role shuffling scheme and if yes how should it be designed to balance fairness and efficiency while providing maximum security?
* How can the computation and implementation of penalties and rewards be automated in a fair and incentive-compatible way with minimal implementation effort?
* How to migrate from the current deployment of three different node types to a unified and more flexible deployment fully governed by the NNS?
* How to design allocation mechanisms that provide incentives for network growth maximizing decentralization along multiple dimensions? How to balance dynamism in local costs, risks and regulations with the need for long-term planning and the supply and demand of ICP overall?
* How to exploit the information about node health and subnet usage for the automatic derivation of suitable thresholds for node replacements and subnet creation?

## 10. Examples where the community can integrate into project

Node providers are the key stakeholders for the plans presented in this proposal. We would greatly appreciate their opinion on how to prioritize the work items listed above and whether we may have missed some important aspects. We plan to rollout first DCs with the new deployment mechanism in Q1 2022 and look forward to tangible feedback from these first trials. We plan to keep the community posted on this topic on a regular basis.

## 11. What we are asking the community

The forum discussion around the roadmap for node management has attracted a lot of interest and contributions from the community during the past days. We have included feedback that we have received so far in this summary. DFINITY engineers and researchers are looking forward to more inputs and discussions once this motion proposal is submitted.




 

# Boundary Nodes Motion Proposal

## Summary

The boundary nodes are the Internet Computer edge infrastructure. This motion proposal sets the future roadmap for boundary nodes. It is proposed to enhance the design and implementation of the boundary nodes in several aspects, to make their deployment and operation more decentralized, make them easier to deploy and upgrade, and increase their security.

## 1. Objective

Design, implement, and deploy enhanced scalable, decentralized, and secure network of boundary nodes for the Internet Computer. This network will serve as the edge framework of the Internet Computer and will be managed by the NNS. It will provide end-to-end security, as well as caching, for users of the IC, while being highly decentralized. The enhanced boundary nodes will also support custom domain names and TLS certificate management.

## 2. Background

Boundary nodes provide the network edge services of the Internet Computer (IC) including enabling standard HTTPS requests from users to canister smart contract APIs on the IC and routing canister smart contract API calls to nodes hosting those contracts on the corresponding subnet, as well as caching, load balancing, rate limiting, IPv4-IPv6 translation (as IC nodes all use IPv6), and integrity verification for content served to users.

To bring the design and implementation of the boundary nodes to the next level with respect to functionality, scalability and decentralization, the currently supported feature set is to be extended and enhanced. Furthermore, the community will be enabled to decide on the allocation and sizing of the edge infrastructure and offer custom domains.

## 3. Why is this important?

The enhancements for boundary nodes in this proposal will enable the IC community to sustainably grow the IC network in a decentralized fashion, while guaranteeing end-to-end security, and providing improved experience for users of the IC and of canister smart contracts that run on top of it.

## 4. Topics under this project

Specifically, this proposal includes the following research and development directions for boundary nodes:

1. Scalability and Reliability - support higher request rates and more client connections by means of smarter traffic management, improved load balancing over nodes in a subnet, failover and more.
2. Decentralization - allow more node providers to deploy boundary nodes by reducing the operational requirements.
3. NNS management - let the NNS manage boundary nodes, including adding, removing, and upgrading nodes and compensating node providers via proposals.
4. Security - integrate security improvements mentioned in the proposals on Trusted Execution Enhanced IC and the decentralized DNS and CA.
5. Domains - enable additional and custom domains for canister smart contracts discovery and enhanced decentralization.
6. Customizable - make it easier for node owners to control the operations and capabilities of their boundary node like API-only boundary nodes, filtering etc.
7. Resiliency - related to the scalability and decentralization goals above, improve the DoS protection mechanisms for the IC.
8. Discovery and Steering - Provide distributed discovery and steering to boundary nodes and different node providers and make it easier for the community to provide such services themselves.
9. HTTP and query API caching - Improve caching on the boundary nodes so that they are compliant with caching standards.
10. Semantic caching - use read-only canister state to serve queries directly from the boundary nodes.
11. Monitoring - enhance monitoring of boundary nodes using, for example, probing, and improved metrics. Provide metrics access to the community e.g. for use in node provider remuneration.
12. Boundary Node Economy - provide remuneration for running boundary nodes and charging canisters for support services (e.g., serving cached results).
13. Compliance with local laws - as recently discussed by the community, the boundary node providers may be liable, by local laws, for content served through their nodes. Our intent is to research mechanisms, review community suggestions, and propose to the community possible mechanisms that would empower boundary node providers to restrict content served through their nodes, such that they remain compliant with local laws. As a consequence of the decentralization goal, the content might still be accessible from other jurisdictions.

## 5. Key milestones

The following milestones are indicative and may not be reached in the order listed here.

* M1: Provide a public and open source process for building a boundary node VM deterministically.
* M2: Enable additional boundary nodes on different domains and include support for them in the CDKs/agent code.
* M3: Have additional boundary nodes either API-only and/or on different domains.
* M4: Introduce an economic model for boundary nodes based on additional monitoring.
* M5: Enable the boundary nodes to be deployed and updated via NNS proposals.
* M6: Increase the number of NNS controlled and remunerated boundary nodes and node providers.
* M7: Improved Scalability, Resilience and Standards Compliant Caching

## 7. Why the DFINITY Foundation should make this a long-running R&D project

Boundary nodes are necessary for the Internet Computer, to provide transparent access for web users, as well as to secure the IC. Boundary nodes are part of the IC, and therefore should be as secure and as decentralized as possible. Therefore, the DFINITY Foundation is committed to researching and designing the next generation of boundary nodes including the above-mentioned areas for the benefit of the IC as a whole.

## 8. Skills and Expertise necessary to accomplish this

The problems described above require the cooperation of networking experts with security and cryptography experts, to design, review, and implement the prospective solutions, as well as to provide detailed security reviews and proofs. Specifically, experts from the following fields are necessary:

* Network systems
* Network management
* Network security
* Systems security
* Secure hardware
* Cryptography
* Distributed systems
* Economics

This project would require both researchers and software engineers with expertise in the above-mentioned fields.

## 9. Open research questions

* Efficiently load balance subnet nodes at the boundary nodes, without introducing high bandwidth and computation overheads
* Fully decentralized discovery and routing for unmodified standard Web2 devices and users
* Semantic caching - execute query calls directly on the boundary nodes, using read-only replicated state and possibly different consistency guarantees
* Boundary node economy - develop an economic model for running the boundary nodes edge network
* Compliance with local laws based on the location of boundary nodes

## 10. Examples where the community can integrate into project

As boundary nodes are an important piece of the IC infrastructure, we expect high community interest in this proposal. We invite the community to join the engineers and researchers of DFINITY in the discussion of this topic. We welcome any ideas for the topics above, as well as any critical assessment. We plan to keep the community posted on this topic on a regular basis.

## 11. What we are asking the community

Please review this proposal and provide us with any feedback you have regarding the boundary nodes. Please also review the other related proposals on trusted execution environments and decentralized DNS and CA. We invite you to engage in the discussion and hope it will be fruitful and useful for the IC community and for the future edge framework of the IC.

# Subnet splitting

## Objective

The internet computer is designed to have unbounded capacity by scaling out to different subnet blockchains. Each subnet however has a limited capacity:

* There is a bound on how large the replicated state (combined state of all canister smart contracts on subnet) can grow
* There is a limited amount of canister smart contracts that can be installed on the subnet
* Every subnet has one blockchain, and blocks are of bounded size, so the bandwidth of accepting updates is bounded
* Every replica of a subnet should process all update calls that reach a subnet, so it has bounded processing capacity.

The load on the different subnets varies wildly. For instance, subnet jtdsg has a replicated state size of 170 GB, while most other subnets hold less than 10 GB. As it stands today, there is no convenient way to balance load between subnets.

We propose to address this issue by introducing a new NNS proposal which would split a subnet into two subnets. The replicas are divided into two groups, each of which will become a separate subnet. The canisters are distributed over the two subnets in a similar fashion, such that each of the two child subnets only have half of the load before the split. Since all replicas already have the state of all canisters that were on the subnet, no slow transfer of state is required and the subnet downtime due to splitting should be minimal.

Both child subnets are half as large as the original subnet, which means they could be less decentralized / secure. To address this, it seems prudent to only split large subnets. A small subnet could be split by first adding new replicas to it.

## Why this is important

If there is too much load on a single subnet, the canister smart contracts on that subnet will suffer from degraded performance. This has already happened: subnet pjljw has been under significant computational load multiple times, which led to all canisters on that subnet experiencing higher latencies.

## Outline of proposed technical solution

To reduce the implementation effort, the following design relies strongly on existing mechanisms such as replica upgrades. The overall design is a trade-off between canister downtime and ease of implementation; possible improvements that can be taken up in a later stage are mentioned in the text.

The following steps describe the procedure to split a parent subnet A into two equal-size child subnets A and B. Even though one of the child subnets inherits the identifier of the parent subnet, both subnets will operate under new threshold keys after the split.

1. Expand the parent subnet: Nodes are added to the parent subnet A using existing NNS proposals until it reaches at least twice the regular size for this type of subnet. The exact number of nodes will be determined such that a >⅔ threshold-signed certification in the expanded parent subnet guarantees that at least one honest node in each of the child subnets has a full copy of the state.
One or more NNS proposals will add new nodes to subnet A. Once accepted, the new nodes will fetch the full state from existing nodes as usual.
2. NNS proposal to split subnet: A new NNS proposal type will be created, where the proposal describes which nodes and which canisters are moved to which of the two child subnets after the split. Once accepted, the registry will mark the subnet with a new splitting flag that temporarily prevents concurrent changes to the subnet (e.g., moving nodes or canisters in and out of the subnet) until after the split.
3. DKGs for child subnets: The NNS subnet performs DKGs to generate fresh threshold keys for both child subnets A and B, assigning key shares to the nodes assigned to A and B.
4. Parent subnet stops and creates final CUP: Parent subnet A stops processing update calls and creates a final catch-up package (CUP), as is currently done before a replica upgrade. Note that the parent subnet continues to process query calls, so that canisters are essentially running in read-only mode.
5. NNS obtains the final CUP of the parent subnet. After the splitting proposal is executed, the NNS will look to obtain the final CUP of the parent subnet. Once it obtains this CUP, the NNS will execute the split and update the registry to replace the parent subnet with the two child subnets. For each of the child subnets, the NNS constructs a genesis CUP in the registry, instructing the subnet from which state to start. This genesis CUP contains the state from the final CUP from the parent subnet, meaning that the child subnet continues from the final pre-split state, and it contains the newly generated threshold key material. Additionally, the routing table (that maps canister ids to subnets) is updated to split the canisters over the two child subnets.
There are multiple approaches on how the NNS can obtain the final CUP of the parent subnet. Ideally, it securely fetches it itself from the parent subnet, but a simpler intermediate solution might be to deliver this CUP via a second NNS proposal that voters can verify.
6. Child subnets A and B restart: All replicas in the child subnets restart, without erasing their execution state (as they would during an upgrade), from the Genesis CUPs found in the registry. All replicas purge the state information of canisters that are not assigned to their subnet.
Special care needs to be taken of in-transit cross-subnet messages and responses from and to canisters that moved to child subnet B. Messages that were in the outgoing streams of these canisters at the moment the parent subnet was stopped continue to be offered by child subnet A. Messages and responses on incoming streams, however, will be met with a new REJECT signal, until the sending subnet updates its routing tables to child subnet B. To ensure ordering guarantees, subnet B initially runs canisters in starting state, meaning that all open call contexts for a canister have to be closed before it can accept new calls. Once all call contexts of a canister are closed, the canisters can transition into the running state and continue processing new calls as usual.


### Skills and Expertise necessary to accomplish this

To achieve the goal of being able to split subnets is clearly a broad R&D effort. Despite the high-level design presented above we expect that many open questions will need to be answered. Answering these questions will require the involvement of many teams all across the IC stack. In addition it also requires broad input from the community to guarantee that we also end up with a usable solution for both canister developers and end users that meets the expectations of the community.

## Canister Migration

The Internet Computer (IC) blockchain is composed of multiple subnet blockchains that can host dapps consisting of canister smart contracts. With the help of chain key cryptography those canisters can transparently communicate with each other by sending messages back and forth irrespective of the subnet they are hosted by. The IC can scale out its computational capacity by adding more subnets. However, currently there is no easy way to move a canister smart contract from one subnet to another for load balancing and co-location purposes.

### Objective

This motion proposal is about efforts related to enabling the migration of canister smart contracts between different subnet blockchains of the IC. The objective of canister migration is to provide a tool for load balancing on the IC by allowing developers to move canisters or groups of canisters from one subnet to another. For example, one could envision moving a popular canister away from an otherwise heavily loaded subnet so that the popular dapp can meet its service level objectives again.

### Why is this important

Currently, the only way to move a canister smart contract from one subnet to another is for the canister developer to implement an API that allows downloading the state of the canister, download the state via this API, create a new canister, upload the state to the new canister, and delete the old canister. Obviously this has quite a few downsides, including but not limited to:

1. Every user of a dapp that is migrated this way would need to trust the entity who downloads and uploads the state to not modify the state before uploading it again.
2. Currently canisters address other canisters using the canister ID. A newly created canister will have a new ID, meaning that currently all canisters that want to talk to the migrated canister will have to be updated to talk to the right canister.
3. One needs to take care that the state of the canister to be migrated is not modified after its state has been downloaded and/or to implement measures to keep the old and the new canister in sync.
4. There is no easy way for users who were using the old canister to find the new canister after a canister has been migrated this way.
5. When users interact with canisters using Internet identity (II) they do so via a principal identifier that is, among others, specific to the canister they interact with. If the canister ID changes upon migration, a canister that uses II will not be able to link interactions of the same user with the old canister and the new canister anymore.

Obviously this is quite a complicated process that requires a lot of effort and where things may easily go wrong. The high-level goal of this project is to make things less cumbersome for dapp developers while at the same time also reducing the required trust assumptions, and in doing so making it easier to scale dapps.

With a growing number of subnets and canisters, a higher degree of automation is required as well, as load balancing tasks can no longer be handled manually.

### Key milestones

Four main milestones are currently envisioned in this project. The first milestone is mostly about improving existing tooling and is less research heavy, while the remaining milestones still require quite some research regarding how a feature like this could be realized at all, and how things can be done so that they are operationally convenient for dapp developers and users. The milestones are as follows:

1. Extend the tooling to make it easier for dapp developers to download the state of their canister and upload it to a different subnet. Note that the first milestone is just about making what is already possible more convenient for developers.
2. Enable migration of canisters via a proposal in a way transparent to dapp developers in the sense that the other canisters that sent messages to the migrating canister before migration will not have to be adapted to send to the new canister. Do note, however, that there will likely be some downtime of the canister during migration and there will be potentially increased latency when talking to the migrated canister via canister-to-canister calls due to the canister migrating to another subnet.
3. Enable migration of canister groups so that dapps that are composed of multiple canisters can migrate as a whole.
4. Further automate canister migration so that canisters (or groups of canisters) can be automatically migrated based on various parameters of the system like the load on a subnet, for example.

Input regarding prioritization or organization of the milestones from the community is highly appreciated.


### Why the DFINITY Foundation should make this a long-running R&D project

This project is important because currently dapp developers may hit scalability issues because of their colocation with other dapps on the same subnet. Without working on this motion proposal dapps may not be able to meet their service level objectives anymore as soon as subnets start to fill up, making it impossible for an application to grow without becoming spread across multiple subnets and incurring extra latency.

### Skills and Expertise necessary to accomplish this

Realizing canister migration will require to develop new schemes and protocols that will enable authentically transferring canisters from one subnet to another and to adapt the existing schemes and protocols to guarantee that the migration process can be done in a way transparent to canisters and users. Clearly this is a broad R&D effort with many open questions requiring the involvement of many teams all across the IC stack that will take years to complete. In addition it also requires broad input from the community to guarantee that the resulting solution meets the needs of both canister developers and users.

### Additional open research questions

While the goals outlined in the previous sections already directly pose many of the research questions that need to be answered, there are also some questions that are less explicit. In this section additional research questions are listed:

* Currently canisters are addressed by their ID and routing happens via the so-called routing table. The routing table maps from ranges of canister IDs to the hosting subnets. Migrating individual canisters will lead to fragmentation of the routing table. It needs to be answered as to how to avoid fragmentation of the routing table while allowing canisters to migrate. Initial directions to answer this question include the introduction of a DNS-like system that would enable a migrated canister to take a new canister ID while its alias remains constant and can be used to look up the current ID of the canister.
* How can migration be done in a way compatible with II, i.e., so that each user interacting with a canister via II before migration will be identified as the same user after migration. As hinted at before, not changing the canister ID upon migration is one way to achieve this. However, not changing the canister ID is in conflict with the previous research question. So the goal of this question is to answer how to get the best of both worlds, i.e., potentially allowing to change the canister ID while also not breaking II.
* What is the downtime of a canister that is migrated and how can the downtime upon migration be minimized?
* Does migration require putting canisters into the stopped state before migration or can this be avoided?
* What are suitable canister placement and re-allocation algorithms?

### Examples where community can integrate into project

As already mentioned before, in the initial phase of this motion input regarding refining the scope and priorities of this project from the community is highly appreciated. In addition many technical discussions with the community are anticipated as the motion and research and development of potential technical solutions to address the goals of this proposal move forward.

# Verifiable subnet recovery with private state

## 1. Objective

The internet computer consists of subnets that should run in a robust manner. That is, up to < 1/3rd of the replicas of a subnet can be malicious or unavailable, and the subnet will still make progress. If more replicas are unavailable at one time, the subnet would stall, and canisters can no longer progress update messages. For such scenarios, the IC supports a subnet recovery operation: via NNS proposals, the governance system can instruct other replicas to take over the responsibility of the subnet immediately. This proposal is about ensuring such NNS proposals are verifiable without revealing the state of a subnet.

## 2. Background

The current state of subnet recovery is as follows:

* Foundation has read access to NNS subnet and its own nodes for all application subnets
* Read access to state on application subnets can be granted to SSH keys via NNS proposals (and removed afterwards), which enables reading the latest subnet state and blockchain artifacts
* If a subnet is stuck, the foundation can perform subnet recovery by
  * obtaining the state + recent blockchain of subnet, which defines a last good state of the subnet
  * Make a recovery NNS proposal including that state hash, which may also indicate which nodes should take over the responsibility of the subnet
* The voters currently cannot verify that this proposal is done correctly
  * If we would release the state + blockchain artifacts, the community could verify the proposal
  * But then the state is made public, which is not desirable

## 3. Milestones

1: Subnet recovery is fully verifiable if the subnet state is public.

Some subnets may hold sensitive information, while others do not. One potential forward direction is to distinguish between these, and first make subnet recovery fully verifiable if the state can be public. This means that every voter can ensure that the state is the correct state and verify all aspects of the proposal.

2: Encrypted subnets can be recovered in a verifiable manner.

Once subnets run with trusted execution environment capabilities (find the relevant motion proposal [here](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/long-term-r-d-tee-enhanced-ic-proposal/9384/4)), this can significantly improve the confidentiality guarantees. For such subnets, subnet recovery should still be available, without affecting confidentiality. This requires significant protocol changes and extensions

* The NNS can create encryption keys for every subnet, which are securely held inside the trusted execution environment
* A subnet will produce blockchain artifacts that can be validated cryptographically while not revealing subnet state. That likely means that e.g. catch-up packages must sign encrypted state.
* From an encrypted state and blockchain artifacts, a verifiable subnet recovery can be performed. That means that the NNS can give the new subnet members the relevant decryption key, and they can recover from the state implied by the encrypted state and the blockchain artifacts.

## 4. Discussion leads

Jan Camenisch, Manu Drijvers

## 5. Skills and Expertise necessary to accomplish this

The first milestone is mainly an engineering effort. The second milestone is a much greater effort, and will require cryptographic protocol design and trusted execution environment expertise.

### DeFi enhancements and support

**Objective:** Expand support for DeFi on the Internet Computer

**Background:** Decentralized finance is a main use case in the blockchain space. Potential advantages of DeFi include increased security, reliability and availability of financial services, and using smart contracts such financial services may run autonomously in a transparent and predictable way. DeFi dapps can be deployed as canister smart contracts on the Internet Computer blockchain to take advantage of the ICs features including scalability and on-chain web support. This project will adapt the Internet Computer to enhance support for DeFi applications. The goal is to make it as easy as possible to develop and deploy capable DeFi dapps and participate in the DeFi ecosystem.

**Current capabilities and related initiatives:**

A basic set of capabilities for enabling DeFi on the Internet Computer has been made available or is already planned or worked on in related initiatives. This will, for example, enable advanced DeFi applications, such as decentralized exchanges (DEXs) based on Automated Market Makers (AMMs) or smart contracts that rely on information available in outside services.

* [Canister smart contracts can transfer ICP](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/enable-canisters-to-hold-icp/6153)
* [Integrating of the IC with the Bitcoin](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/direct-integration-with-bitcoin/6147) and Ethereum blockchains
* [General integration with external systems,](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/long-term-r-d-general-integration-proposal/9383) e.g., oracles to interact with other blockchains or traditional web, or integrations of the Internet Computer with other blockchains or services providing this functionality (this is proposed in a separate initiative)

**Research topics:**

First-class DeFi support on the IC requires further functionalities and efforts, for example:

* Fiduciary subnets with more nodes and stricter security controls on canisters
* Support for tokenization on SNSs and transfer of the tokens  (see also SNS proposal)
* Atomic transactions 
* Community standards to facilitate DeFi, e.g., a unified IC token standard (a main task of the Foundation in this area is helping coordinate and converge community efforts)
* Support for ERC20-like and other token standards
  * A unified IC token standard (e.g, an ERC20-like standard or more advanced variant thereof that can be widely adopted by the community)
  * Specifically stablecoin / Fiat integration (this has many use cases, yet is technically just a token integration)
* Tools to integrate with traditional finance e.g. KYC, tax reporting 
* Increased transparency and control on the IC: verifiable record of interactions with a neuron, timestamps of neuron reward events, ability to deny/accept payments to users/canister subaccounts
* Token and assets management for ordinary users (custody services) (so users do not need to rely on key management using air-gapped computers)

In addition, it is beneficial to have the following available:

* Guidance for dapp development, e.g., separating financial logic in immutable contracts from business logic in dapps
* Tools to support development of secure smart contracts, e.g., formally verifiable canisters

This initiative relates closely to the related initiatives mentioned above, which can be seen as providing some of the foundational building blocks (e.g., oracle functionality or integrations with other blockchains) that are also, but not exclusively, applicable to DeFi.

**Skills and expertise:** A range of skills are needed here, including insight into both traditional finance and decentralized finance, and design and engineering of the IC & the IC governance and support tooling. Several teams will be involved including the Growth team for building the ecosystem, the Financial Integrations team, the NNS team and the SDK team.

**How to work with the community:** The community will play a direct role in this initiative in shaping DeFi standards, sharing its experience and best practices from building DeFi dapps and the resulting requirements of the IC. This interaction can take place over existing channels such as the developer forum but different approaches such as forming committees of community members are also in scope.

**What we are asking the community:**

* Review comments, ask questions, give feedback
* Vote accept or reject on NNS Motion
* Participate in technical discussions as the motion moves forward

Motivation: Increase the capacity of the network
                         # Update the GuestOS firewall rules to prepare for adding new DCs

To be able to add new DCs into the network, we need to allow the existing nodes
to peer with the new nodes by updating the GuestOS firewall rules.

Here are the rules that we add:
```
2001:438:fffd:11c::/64
2001:4d78:400:10a::/64
2600:3000:1300:1300::/64
2600:c0d:3002:4::/64
2604:6800:258:1::/64

2a02:800:2:2003::/64
2a0b:21c0:b002:2::/64
```
There was also a change from 2604:B900:4001:76::/64 to 2604:b900:4001:76::/64 (lower case "b")

   # Recover subnet fuqsr-in2lc-zbcjj-ydmcw-pzq7h-4xm2z-pto4i-dcyee-5z4rz-x63ji-nae

Subnet fuqsr was recently created by proposal 35958. However due to a bug caused by different replica version running on spare nodes, different nodes created slightly different genesis CUP (Catch Up Package). Consequently the subnet failed to start and has to be recovered.

The recovery is to let NNS create a new CUP for this subnet.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                # Upgrade frontend NNS Dapp canister to commit 587d2fb

Updating Internet Identity to commit 1f799fe868691a2b4bd698bcf0541debe71ee14d

## Rationale:

This update blocks registration on unexpected origins as explained here: https://forum.dfinity.org/t/internet-identity-proposal-to-deprecate-account-creation-on-all-origins-other-than-https-identity-ic0-app/9760
Additionally, minor refactorings and improvements regarding security (CSP header) are also included.

Motivation: Upgrade the subnet 1 (snjp4) to rc--2022-01-06-10-37
 Update subnet shefu-t3kr5-t5q3w-mqmdq-jabyv-vyvtf-cyyey-3kmo4-toyln-emubw-4qe to replica version 936bf9ccaabd566c68232e5cb3f3ce7d5ae89328

Motivation: Upgrade the subnet 8 (shefu) to rc--2022-01-06-10-37
                    The ICP Maximalist Network (ICPMN) proposes that Dfinity Foundation shall add the ICPMN Neuron ID 4966884161088437903 to the list of named Followee options in the NNS dApp.  The neuron shall be labeled as ICP Maximalist Network in the list.
 
The ICPMN neuron will be representative of the enthusiasts, end users, investors, developers, project leaders, Dfinity and ICA members, and other IC ecosystem contributors who participate in our community.  A primary objective will be to ensure that our neuron can be trusted to always vote on all proposals.  The neuron will be configured to follow our elected voting members on all Governance proposals and to follow Dfinity Foundation (DF) and/or Internet Computer Association (ICA) on non-Governance proposals.
 
Ownership and configuration of this community neuron as well as voting member expectations are described in the policy document published at https://www.ic.community/followee-neuron-for-icp-maximalist-network/
 
You can join the active ICP Maximalist Network community on Telegram at https://t.me/icpmaximalistnetwork
 
Motivation for this proposal - At ICP genesis, the NNS was configured to set ICA as the default Followee for the Governance topic for all neurons.  DF and ICA are currently the only named neurons in the list of available neurons in the NNS dApp and people configuring their neuron can easily select these neurons to follow for voting.  In an effort to accelerate decentralization of the internet computer, DF and ICA are going to be removed as default Followees for Governance topics and voting rewards will be weighted by proposal type. Hence, there will be a new need for people in the IC community to find other neurons to follow in order to continue getting paid their voting rewards.  It is desirable to have a diverse and reliable selection of Followees listed in the NNS app to make it easy for people to find Followee options.  Several organizations are responding to this challenge including cycle_dao, ICDevs, and ICP Maximalist Network, each of which represent special interests within the IC community.  It should be noted that all neuron owners are encouraged to vote manually on Governance topics that you consider to be important even if you select Followees for the Governance topic.  Manual voting is the only way to guarantee that your neuron votes according to what you believe is in the long term best interest of the internet computer. cycle_dao proposes that Dfinity Foundation shall add the cycle_dao Neuron ID 5967494994762486275 to the list of named Followee options in the NNS dApp.  The neuron shall be labeled as cycle_dao in the list.
 
cycle_dao aims to advance the needs of the internet computer ecosystem. To understand what these needs are, cycle_dao monitors social media & the DFINITY developer forum, engages with the DFINITY Foundation, canvases different segments of the community, and conducts focus group interviews. The cycle_dao neuron follows other neurons to ensure its participation in every vote, but itself votes on all governance topics. Explanation of voting decisions can be found at https://cycledao.xyz/blog.
 
The cycle_dao neuron is currently controlled by 11 council members representing different interests in the Internet Computer community through Axon.ooo. A quorum of 3 members is required to execute a vote. Council membership changes periodically depending on the availability of members. Some or all members may elect to withhold their identities in the future in favor of anonymous participation.

Motivation for this proposal - At ICP genesis, the NNS was configured to set ICA as the default Followee for the Governance topic for all neurons.  DF and ICA are currently the only named neurons in the list of available neurons in the NNS dApp and people configuring their neuron can easily select these neurons to follow for voting.  In an effort to accelerate decentralization of the internet computer, DF and ICA are going to be removed as default Followees for Governance topics and voting rewards will be weighted by proposal type. Hence, there will be a new need for people in the IC community to find other neurons to follow in order to continue getting paid their voting rewards.  It is desirable to have a diverse and reliable selection of Followees listed in the NNS app to make it easy for people to find Followee options.  Several organizations are responding to this challenge including cycle_dao, ICDevs, and ICP Maximalist Network, each of which represent special interests within the IC community.  It should be noted that all neuron owners are encouraged to vote manually on Governance topics that you consider to be important even if you select Followees for the Governance topic.  Manual voting is the only way to guarantee that your neuron votes according to what you believe is in the long term best interest of the internet computer. ICDevs.org proposes that Dfinity Foundation shall add the ICDevs.org Neuron ID 14231996777861930328 to the list of named Followee options in the NNS dApp.  The neuron shall be labeled as ICDevs.org in the list.
 
The ICDevs.org neuron will be representative of the application, service, and protocol developers building on the Internet Computer.  A primary objective will be to ensure that our neurons can be trusted to always vote on all proposals.  The neuron will be configured to the guidance of the ICDevs.org Developer Advisory Council on Governance proposals, with backup followings for governance issues not relative to developers. The backup following will be decided by the Developer Advisory https://icdevs.org/developer_advisory_committee.html Committee. The neuron will follow Dfinity Foundation (DF) and/or Internet Computer Association (ICA) on non-Governance proposals but will reserve the right to vote on non-governance proposals that affect developers.  Voting by the Committee is subject to US 501c3 laws and restricted by the bylaws of ICDevs.org that can be found at https://icdevs.org/bylaws.html and thus the Executive Director has been granted the right and responsibility to refer issues to the ICDevs.org board if they may violate US law or the bylaws of ICDevs.org. In these rare cases, the board of ICDevs.org may choose to abstain from the vote on that issue or to ratify the vote of the Committee.
 
Configuration of this neuron, as well as voting member expectations, are described in the policy document published at https://icdevs.org/developer_advisory_committee.html

Manual voting is the only way to guarantee that your neuron votes according to what you believe is in the long term best interest of the internet computer. Summary
This proposal is intended to enable all neuron owners to vote on any NNS proposal with the topic called Governance with their own brains at any time within the voting period even if their Followees have voted. It also enables all Followees to cast their vote at any time.

Introduction
Currently, if a Followee neuron votes, then liquid democracy is executed immediately and all applicable votes for neurons that are following that Followee neuron are cast immediately. Since Difinity Foundation and Internet Computer Association are disabling default following for proposals on the governance topic and the voting rewards will be weighted based on the topic (see https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/34485), this means people will start looking for other organizations with neurons they want to follow for the specific proposal topic called Governance. It is impractical to expect that organizations will time their votes until the very end of a proposal to allow individuals to vote manually. Therefore, this proposal intends to enable Followee organizations to vote any time they want within the voting period. If individuals vote manually at any time within the voting period, then this vote is what counts and the votes that would be sent by following are disregarded on Governance proposals.

Proposal
1 - Do not execute Follower votes immediately…only include votes that are cast manually in the calculation of Current Voting Result.
2 - Create a new Projected Voting Result calculation that accounts for all manually cast votes and all Follower votes that result from liquid democracy.
3 - In the Wait for Quiet algorithm, define the “trend” and make algorithmic decisions based on the Projected Voting Result. (See Note below, which is intended to give Dfinity the ability to carefully think about whether the algorithmic decisions should be based on the Current Voting Result instead)
4 - At the conclusion of the voting period, execute Follower votes. Afterward, the Current Voting Result will match the Projected Voting Result.
5 - In the NNS app and on http://dashboard.dfinity.org/governance , display both Current Voting Result and Projected Voting Result
Note: During the realization phase of this proposal, it is acceptable to modify the details if needed to develop a better way to meet the objective of the proposal than what is outlined in the concrete proposal above.

Explanation
In this proposal, Current Voting Result will be based on votes that have been cast manually and are not reversible. Projected Voting Result will be a calculation of the result if all Follower votes were cast based on their Followee assignments. Simple Majority and Absolute Majority will still execute automatically according to Current Voting Results, but Wait for Quiet is based on Projected Voting Result (or possibly Current Voting Result, see Note). Projected Voting Result would change when a vote is cast manually if the vote is different than the Followee vote. This voting mechanism would not accept proposals before the end of the voting period unless the Absolute Majority is obtained by way of manual voting. This proposal enables voters who disagree with a Projected Voting Result to cast their vote manually even if the Projected Voting Result is an Absolute Majority. When they cast their vote manually, it will change the Projected Voting Result and may or may not change the “trend” as per the Wait for Quiet algorithm.

For the purpose of this proposal, the term voting period refers to the total time it takes to execute a proposal vote (inclusive of the Wait for Quiet algorithm) according to the applicable methodology for how the voting duration is determined. This means the voting period will be anywhere from 4 days to 8 days due to a recent proposal to extend the wait for quiet algorithm (https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/33658).

This proposal maximizes the time for which every voter can vote with their own brain on each proposal, while still ensuring that they can configure Followees when they prefer to allow others to cast their vote for them.

This proposal is only intended to apply to Governance proposals. Application to other types of proposals would be at the discretion of Dfinity if they think there is value.

Timeline
This proposal will be open for deliberation until after the new year before the formal proposal is submitted to the NNS. Comments are appreciated during this deliberation phase and actionable suggestions that improve the design intent of this proposal may be included with the proposal. If this proposal passes, then the desired outcome would be for Dfinity to develop the required code changes quickly, but also give due consideration to the need for a thorough security review. A strict timeline is not imposed with this proposal.

Background
This concept has been in deliberation in a forum topic for the last 3 weeks and can be viewed at… https://forum.dfinity.org/t/proposal-to-enable-manual-voting-throughout-the-entire-voting-period-of-governance-proposals/9815 
This concept was shaped by conversation in another forum topic… https://forum.dfinity.org/t/proposal-to-include-cycle-dao-icdevs-as-default-follow-target-neurons-to-the-nns/9363/31

## Release notes

### New features

* Merge Neurons: Adds the ability to merge the stake of a source neuron into a target neuron, age and dissolve delay are updated accordingly.
* Known Neurons: Adds the ability to submit a new type of proposal: Known Neuron. This proposal updates a list of Known Neurons to make it easier
for neuron holders to know who to follow. This update is backend governance only, a follow up update will include this functionality in the NNS
UI.
* Node Provider Rewards: Add a Governance method to return the monthly Node Provider rewards

### Improvements
* Spawn Neuron: Allow to provide a subaccount to be used in the spawned neuron, by providing the nonce that will be used to generate said subaccount.
* Wait for Quiet: Extend the proposal deadline (long), and maximum deadline extension to 96 h.

      # Replace a node in subnet fuqsr.

    After recent issues [1] with increased manifest computation times in subnet `jtdsg`, leading to newly joining and/or fallen behind replicas no longer being able to successfully catch up to the most recent subnet state, a subnet management proposal to slow down the block rate of the subnet to 0.5 blocks per second was submitted and accepted [2]. Slowing down the block rate of the subnet resolved the immediate issue and allowed replicas to catch up again, but clearly a solution to the problem that does not require reducing the block rate of the subnet was needed. In [1] necessary optimizations to achieve this were described. Meanwhile most of them are implemented and included in the most recently elected replica version [3], and a proposal to upgrade subnet `jtdsg` to this replica version was accepted [4]. This brings manifest computation times to a range that allows to increase the block rate again. Concretely, the recent updates have reduced the manifest computation time for this subnet from approximately 5 minutes (when [2] slowed down the subnet) to 15 seconds now. 

This proposal restores the block rate of subnet `jtdsg` to 1 block per second, reverting the change of [2].

     ## Summary:

Updating Internet Identity to commit c5709518ce3daaf7fdd9c7994120b66bd613f01b

## Rationale:

This includes a new badge ("built on crypto") with logo, makes certification
more secure when fetching the CAPTCHA, and improves error messages. Since last
release there were also some infrastructure changes that shouldn't impact the
build.

Notes:

## Restoration of lost neuron age

Due to a recently fixed bug in the `Merge` neurons operation of the
`ManageNeuron` command, any neurons that were the source of a merge operation
experienced a loss of age, and thus their age bonus. This in turn reduced the
rewards that would have been earned by those neurons from that point in time.

It was found that 77 valid ingress messages were finalized by consensus which
applied the `Merge` operation. One can determine, by looking at the current
stake of those source neurons, whether the merge actually happened. In only
one case it did not.

Two actions need to be taken for the affected groups of neurons:

1. The age lost from the source neuron must be restored to the target
   neuron.
2. Any rewards lost due to the reduction in age bonus must be restored to
   the target neuron.

## Restoring lost age

Using a snapshot of NNS state from Jan 10, the day before the release of the
`Merge` feature, it could be determined what the original stake and age of the
source neurons were at that time. Also knowing the moment in time that the
`Merge` operation was performed, one can calculate the pre-merge age of each
source neuron as follows:

    original age = age on Jan 10 + time between Jan 10 and merge operation

In some casse, multiple source neurons were merged into a single target
neuron. To calculate what the age of the target neuron would have been, had
the bug not been present, one would use this calculation:

    corrected age = a_1' + (s_2 * a_2 + ... + s_n * a_n) / s_1'

In this equation, subscript `_1'` refers to the current target neuron's stake
and age (post-merge), and the subscripts `_2` to `n` represent the original
source neurons' stake and age (pre-merge). The resulting age is what the
target neuron's combined age should have been.

Note that this calculation is only for restoring the age as it should have
been calculated. The usual equation for combining ages is as follows, for
reference, which should have been applied to the pre-merge neurons:

    combined age =
        (s_1 * a_1 + s_2 * a_2 + ... + s_n * a_n) / (s_1 + s_2 + ... + s_n)

One can convince themselves of the correctness of this by simple algebric
rewriting, here using three terms for clarity's sake. A proof in Coq was used
to confirm this:

    Theorem proved :
      ∀ s₁ a₁ s₂ a₂ s₃ a₃ : R,
      s₁ > 0 → s₁ + s₂ + s₃ > 0 →
      let s₁' := s₁ + s₂ + s₃ in
      let a₁' := (s₁ * a₁ + s₂ * 0 + s₃ * 0) / (s₁ + s₂ + s₃) in
      (s₁ * a₁ + s₂ * a₂ + s₃ * a₃) / (s₁ + s₂ + s₃)
        = a₁' + (s₂ * a₂ + s₃ * a₃) / s₁'.

## Restoring lost rewards

The other item to be restored are the lost rewards due to the loss in voting
power from the time of the merge until the time of this proposal. This was
done as follows:

For every source neuron whose age was dropped, determine what it's voting
power would have been with and without its age bonus. Since every neuron
affected by this issue was staked for 8-years, the equation for voting power
in each case is simple:

    stake * 2 * age_bonus(age)

The `age_bonus` is a factor from 1 to 1.25x, scaling linearly from 1x at 0
years to 1.25x at 4 years.

The next factor is to determine the current total voting power in the NNS.
This data was obtained from [The Internet Computer Dashboard](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/governance).
At the time the bug was fixed, this voting power stood at 400,976,838. Based
on that voting power and the total supply figure, the daily allocation of
voting rewards (in the form of maturity) was reported as 119,419.

It is then assumed that this voting power and reward allocation held constant
over the past two weeks, since the precise data to know the shape of that
curve is unavailable. So, using these numbers, it can be determined exactly
how much each source neuron would have earned both with and without its age:

    daily voting rewards * (voting power without age / total voting power)
    daily voting rewards * (voting power with age / total voting power)

The difference between these two figures represents the amount of maturity
lost daily due to the bug. To calculate the total amount lost, it suffices to
multiply this by the time since the merge was performed. Because it cannot be
determined when the merge was actually successful, the benefit of the doubt is
given and the very first merge operation involving each neuron is used.

## Network changes to restore these values

A Python script (link) was used to calculate the amounts based on the
following data:

1. A scan of all ingress blocks from Jan 10, a day before the `Merge`
   functionality was shipped, until the block when the fix was delivered and
   installed.

2. A snapshot of the NNS subnet state on Jan 10.

3. A thorough review of the above data to identify obviously incorrect merge
   attempts (such as merges to or from neuron 0, etc).

A directed-graph was built of all the merge operations, in order to determine
the "sets" of merged neurons, and the final neuron they targeted for the
purposes of restoration. These sets were fed to the Python script, whose
output was a Rust array that will be used by Governance to apply the corrected
values.

In the case of maturity, it is enough to simply add the calculated missing
maturity to the target neuron. This represent as additional allocation of
rewards for that day, and is predicted to increase total rewards on the day
the proposal is executed by 5%.

In the case of age, the target neuron's age must be adjusted to accommodate
both the missing age of the source neurons, and the fact that merging neurons
with no age caused a dilution in the age of the target neuron. See the math in
the above section for the exact details of how this was calculated.

The final rust array is follows:

    // To restore the maturity, simply add maturity_to_add
    //
    // To restore the age, use the current stake and age of the
    // target neuron and set the new age to:
    //   age + (source_stake * lost_age) / stake
    //
    // The current age should be used as a validation check
    
    // The format of each value in the vector is:
    // ( neuron_to_adjust, current_timestamp, source_stake, lost_age, voting_power_increase, lost_maturity )

### Impact on stakeholders

There was only one group of neurons that was significantly affected by this
bug, in the amount of 10,499.14606806 ICP. The total net cost of the bug to
all of the other neuron holders was less than 0.05 ICP.

Only 6 affected lots were found, resulting in the above adjustments to six
target neurons. Once this update is performed, the bug will have been
corrected and lost voting power of the target neurons will be restored.

Service nervous systems (SNSs) are algorithmic DAOs that allow developers to create decentralized, token-based governance systems for their dapps. 

After the community adopted the R&D motion proposal stating that the foundation should work on this topic, this present motion proposal suggests a concrete design for an open governance canister implementation that can then be used to realise the SNSs. 

The proposed governance canister design is similar to the  governance canister of the Network Nervous System (NNS) but simpler and more flexible, allowing each SNS community to choose the configurations according to their needs. This design is also presented and discussed in this forum: https://forum.dfinity.org/t/open-governance-canister-for-sns-design-proposal/10224 .

## Background

### Relation to the original SNS design & overall approach
DFINITY Foundation presented a first proposed [SNS design](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4443aaAP5A) in October 2021. The community feedback was that the SNS design was rather complex and does not leave a lot of freedom to developers to configure a DAO to their needs. Some developers mentioned that they have a particular DAO or use case in mind and are only interested in an implementation of a ledger or governance canister, which they plan to integrate with existing canisters. 

The goal of SNSs is also to eventually provide open governance solutions *on the press of a button* for those who are not experienced developers themselves. This motivates that a concrete implementation and usable interfaces to deploy and upgrade SNSs are provided to the community.

To address all of these concerns, DFINITY Foundation proposes the following new approach:
1. Release the different building blocks in multiple stages, such that the community can make use of intermediate deliverables (e.g., single canisters) as soon as they are ready
2. Evolve these single building blocks to arrive at a concrete implementation that can be used without engineering efforts
3. Make the concrete implementation modular and the single components configurable so that each SNS can be configured as suitable for the dapp that it governs

### Context with other SNS projects 
More concretely, We (the DFINITY Foundation) proposes the following initial stages:

1. Improve the NNS ledger canister so that it can also be used for other tokens
2. **Implement a governance canister (the design presented and discussed in this proposal)**
3. Tooling and support for the deployment and upgrade of SNSs that consist of multiple canisters, including the ledger and governance canister from above (design will be presented in a separate forum thread in the coming weeks)
4. More steps towards allowing SNSs on the press of a button, including frontend support, support for initial token distribution etc. (less concrete, this depends on the previous steps and the feedback there)
 

## Proposed design for the open governance canister

### Summary design
On a high level, the idea is to reuse only those concepts of the NNS that are relevant. 
This would allow us to reuse some code from the NNS governance canister but simplify the design by omitting concepts that are only relevant in the context of the NNS.

More concretely, DFINITY Foundation proposes to reuse the concepts of 
* *neurons*, which facilitate stake-based voting that guarantees that voters are invested in the respective governance token and therefore incentivized to vote in the best interest of the system.
* *proposals* as the SNS should allow users to make suggestions, e.g., how to evolve the associated dapp, and for others to vote on these decisions.

As with the NNS governance, it is expected that the governance canister is deployed with an associated ledger canister, where it is determined how much stake each neuron has. 

Moreover, compared to the NNS where some configurations can only be changed by canister upgrades, in this open governance canister most configurations should be defined as parameters that can easily be configured at deployment and changed by proposals. This will allow each developer and community to tweak the governance rules to their needs.

### More design details
We next introduce some more details of the design, with a special focus on things that are different compared to the NNS governance canister. 

Note that some details have a remark *if feasible in a timely manner*. We propose that we implement these features in the first implementation if the effort is not too large. Otherwise, we propose to favor an earlier release and add those features in a next iteration.

### Proposals
In the NNS governance, proposals have both a type, determining what they will do exactly, and a topic, based on which neurons can follow other neurons in the decision making (liquid democracy). 
As each SNS will have very different use cases, we propose to omit the concept of proposal topics and facilitate following based on the proposal types.
Moreover, we propose that an open governance canister supports at least the following proposals by default: 
* A proposal to change the governance parameters 
* A proposal to upgrade one canister, that can e.g., be used to upgrade a dapp canister
* Motion proposals that facilitate discussions in the community but do not have any immediate, automatic effect

### Neurons
Regarding neurons, we propose:
- omitting the neuron attributes and methods that are specific to NNS use cases. 
- having the following neuron attributes (with motivation):
    - (If this is feasible due to storage restrictions) omit the ID of neurons and use the account of neurons on the ledger canister as the identifier instead
    - (If this is feasible in a timely manner) provide an access control list for neurons that specifies which principals can perform which neuron actions. For the first version, start with a simple logic that describes two keys similarly to the controller and hot keys in the NNS governance canister. Later, provide methods that allow defining valid access control lists by governance canisters and that allow neuron holders to change the access control of their individual neurons within these valid options.
    - (As in the NNS) The amount of staked governance tokens.
    - (As in the NNS) The time when the neuron was created.
    - (As in the NNS) The dissolve state of neurons specifying whether a neuron is dissolving, i.e., the timer when the staked tokens can be retrieved is decreasing, or non-dissolving, i.e., the time how much into the future the staked tokens can be retrieved is stopped and the age of neurons specifying how long the neuron has been in non-dissolving state.These concepts allow incentive systems where neuron holders that commit to the system for a longer time have more say or get more rewards.
    - (As in the NNS) Followees of a  neuron. This allows for voting with a liquid democracy, where neurons can choose to delegate their vote to other neurons.
    - (As in the NNS) maturity of a neuron which keeps track of the rewards that a neuron has collected. This allows governance participation to be rewarded.
 
* the following commands for managing neurons (similar to the NNS governance, except for omitting disburse_to_neuron which has an NNS specific use case):
    - *Claiming and refreshing* of a neuron. This is needed to stake a neuron and then top up a the stake of a neuron.
    - *Configuring* a neuron, including increasing the dissolve delay, start dissolving, and stop dissolving a neuron. This allows a neuron holder to choose the dissolve state and age of their neuron, which are explained above.
    - *Making a proposal*, *registering a vote*, and *configuring followers*, which allow a neuron to participate in governance decisions. 
    - *Retrieving and Merging Maturity*, which allows a neuron to mint the governance tokens corresponding to the rewards that it has accumulated and either retrieve them from the neuron or merge reinvest them by adding them to the stake of a neuron.
    - *Disburse* which allows a neuron holder to liquidate again the staked tokens.
    - (If this is feasible in a timely manner) Splitting and merging neurons which are convenient methods for neuron holders to organize their neurons.
- in contrast to the NNS neurons, making all neuron attributes public, including the controllers of a neurons. This simplifies the APIs and allows for more auditability. 
- omitting the proposals of topic *manageNeuron* that allow multiple principals to control a neuron and the associated use cases for the neurons (e.g., in access control and voting). Instead, allow canisters to control neurons.
- making some implementation improvements along the way.

## Security
We consider this to be a security critical feature, as the upgrades of dapps and the value of associated governance tokens are at risk if there are vulnerabilities. We thus plan that both the design and implementation will be reviewed by DFINITY security team. 

## Alternatives considered
Some different approaches that we could have taken and why we decided against them:

* We could have waited with releasing until we have the full SNS implemented. 
=> As argued above, we decided against this as it seemed to be a wish from the community to be able to use the single components as soon as possible.
* We could have decided to just reuse the NNS governance code.
=> We decided against this as there are some NNS specific things in the NNS governance canister that we do not need in the SNS. It also seemed to be a wish from the community to keep things as simple as possible, which supports this.
* We could have generalized the NNS governance code and then reuse it for both the NNS and the SNS. 
=> We decided against this as NNS upgrades are security critical and have to be considered carefully. Moreover, it would take more time to generalize the NNS code, taking into account all of the NNS specific components. Therefore, we favored using a new code base for SNS as this will allow for faster feature delivery.

## Risks and mitigations
As already discussed, there are security risks involved in this project. Therefore, this project requires thorough testing and security reviews and reasoning. We mitigate the risk of unforeseen findings by involving the testing and security experts early in the process.

## Community conversation & Timeline
The NNS team is ready to work on this feature!
To get the design approved by the community, we followed the following schedule:

* Jan 11-18th: Design discussion on the forum thread
* Jan 18th: Community conversation about the topic
* Jan 20th: Developer discussion on Discord
* today: motion proposal submission proposing the above design


## What we are asking the community:

* Vote accept or reject on NNS Motion
* Participate in technical discussions as the motion moves forward

Developer Forum: https://forum.dfinity.org/t/open-governance-canister-for-sns-design-proposal/10224/10 

                                                          The average number of votes cast on governance proposals is 21M, which represents approx 5% of total voting power today.  This is a surprisingly low voter turnout.  ICP is a governance token.  It does not exist for passive investment.  Fortunately, the ICP tokenomics are designed to incentivize participation in governance.  If you vote, then you get voting rewards.  If you do not vote, then you do not get voting rewards.  Voting rewards are distributed proportional to the voting power of all the neurons that cast votes.  The key to success in maximizing voting rewards is to vote on all proposals.  

A proposal (34485) was passed on December 14, 2021 as a motion proposal that suggested two fundamental changes: a) disable default following for proposals on the governance topic and b) weigh the voting rewards based on the topic.  When this proposal gets implemented, there will be a meaningful difference between neurons that vote on governance topics and neurons that do not vote on governance topics.  Every neuron owner that wants to maximize voting rewards will want to actively participate in governance.

There are two ways to ensure that your neuron is maximizing voting rewards: 1) manually vote on each proposal or 2) manually configure your neuron with a Followee for the Governance topic that you trust to always vote according to your best interests.  Make sure you follow a neuron you trust to vote and make sure you configure your neuron correctly.

This proposal is the first in a series of governance motion proposals that will be submitted daily.  Every proposal will have a brief summary that will discuss ICP governance in some way that is educational for the IC community.  The neurons that vote will get voting rewards whether or not these proposals are adopted or rejected.  Please vote so you can maximize your voting rewards.  A goal of submitting these daily proposals is for voter participation to increase significantly on governance topics.

   Today all NNS proposal topics are weighted equally.  There are 144 Exchange Rate proposals every day that execute automatically (every 10 minutes).  It is also common to see several System Canister Management, Subnet Management proposals, and/or Node Admin proposals on a daily basis.  Governance proposals happen less frequently, but are the proposal topics that require decentralized governance decisions.  Therefore, Dfinity Foundation and the Internet Computer Association intentionally abstain from voting on Governance proposals.  Since all proposals are weighted equally and since all neurons follow ICA by default on the All Topics catch all category when neurons are created, there is little economic incentive to participate in voting on Governance topic proposals.  This is why we see low voter turnout on Governance proposals even though they are arguably the most important proposals and sometimes generate the most passionate deliberation on the forum.

A recent proposal (34485) included a suggestion to change the weights that apply to Exchange Rate and Governance proposal topics.  Specifically, it was proposed that Exchange rate proposals should have a weight of 0.01 and Governance topics should have a weight of 20 while all other topics retain a weight of 1.  Deliberation on this proposal started at the end of November 2021 on the forum and was passed as a NNS Governance Motion proposal on December 14, 2021.  It passed by an overwhelming majority with a voter participation rate of 11.7%.  The motivation for this proposal was to “ensure that a significant portion of voting rewards will now come from voting on governance proposals” and that “neuron holders have a strong incentive to either vote directly on all governance proposals or explicitly configure their neurons to follow such proposals.”

Proposal 34485 has not been implemented yet, but when it does, your voting rewards will change if you do not vote on Governance proposals.  These are economic incentives for you to get involved in ICP governance by making sure that your neuron votes.  There will be many people who observe that their voting rewards have changed and will start asking questions.  The active IC community will need to be ready to explain the change and provide recommendations on how to maximize voting rewards by participating in governance.  Manual action will be required, either by voting on every proposal or by following neurons that can be trusted to vote in your best interest.  

This proposal is part of a series of Governance motion proposals that will be submitted daily. Every proposal will have a brief summary that will discuss ICP governance in some way that is educational for the IC community.  The action that is requested with these proposals is for you to demonstrate participation in governance by voting.  The neurons that vote will get voting rewards whether or not these proposals are adopted or rejected.  Please vote so you can maximize your voting rewards.  A goal of submitting these daily proposals is for voter participation to increase significantly on Governance topics.

     ## Summary:

Updating Internet Identity to commit 4873fc008bb97c02609d4a918c869f111dd5692a

## Rationale:

This completes the deployment of (rolled back) proposal 42415. This the
rationale of the original proposal:

> This includes a new badge ("built on crypto") with logo, makes certification more secure when fetching the CAPTCHA, and improves error messages. Since last release there were also some infrastructure changes that shouldn't impact the build.

The original proposal introduced an issue on mainnet where the browser could
not reach the canister (and the IC) due to incorrect CSP settings. Proposal
42415 was rolled back in proposal 42421.

This new release includes the following:

1. Fix the CSP policy
2. Read canister ID from canister

Point 2. above allowed us to test this release on mainnet to make sure the CSP
issue was indeed fixed.

Detailed list of changes since last working release:
```

                                                   The first two proposals in this series were intended to explain how participants in governance are incentivized to participate and why some of those incentives will be changing.  This proposal provides a list of references that are useful for learning about and engaging in discussions about IC governance.

A new Internet Computer Wiki has been started in recent weeks and already has great content that is easy to reference in community conversations.  This wiki also contains links to numerous medium.com articles that are published by Dfinity, which include tokenomics and governance information.  https://wiki.internetcomputer.org/wiki/Internet_Computer_wiki

The Dfinity developer Forum is the go to place for active and highly engaged discussion on current and past governance topics. Select the Governance or Roadmap categories to see deliberation topics on current and upcoming proposals.  https://forum.dfinity.org/

The Dashboard is where you can see all current and past proposal details and voting results.  Select the Governance section and filter by Topic if you want to see governance proposals only.  https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/

Governance topics are commonly discussed in various social media circles such as:
ICP Maximalist Network on Telegram (https://t.me/icpmaximalistnetwork)
Internet Computer Weekly podcast with Arthur Falls from cycledao.xyz
Twitter Spaces with @ICDevs_org, @weedpatchtwo, @BobBodily, @lastmjs, @icpjesse


Special thanks to well known IC community member @EasyStevie_e for this Twitter thread on 2/2/22 expressing his opinion about this series of educational governance proposals:
My take on an interesting proposal:  You may believe this proposal doesn’t effectively do anything, and you would be correct.  You could also say this proposal does in fact do something, and you would be correct. The purpose is to raise awareness about voting incentives and the power of liquid democracy to drive future participation. No matter the result there will be no change to NNS governance. However, there will be a change within NNS governance. Voter turnout is already incredible with over 9.58% on day 1. If a set of proposals that effectively do nothing spark conversation and increase voter turnout by a statistically significant amount then you could factually say they do change NNS Governance. I view this proposal to be asking if you are in favor of increased participation in our liquid democracy. Voting yes or no serves as a Yes vote, to abstain serves as a No vote. I voted yes as I believe the positive psychological impact to be greater than no. If you disagree with the NNS being used in this way I understand. You could argue that this is a misuse of governance proposals and have a leg to stand on. Fortunately this is a liquid democracy, you can submit a proposal to prevent this type of behavior from happening.  Whether a counter proposal would pass or not, the original proposal has achieved its purpose. It made us discuss, change, vote, and adapt.  This community is so insane and brilliant. Not a day goes by where I don’t count myself thankful for being a part of it.                                                                                                                                           Decentralization of Internet Computer governance has been an evolution that has occurred somewhat rapidly since genesis.  Dfinity Foundation has always been clear that they want the community to make governance decisions through voting with the Network Nervous System in a decentralized way and they have taken steps to enable that transition.

The first governance motion proposal that DF intended to be decided by the IC community occurred on Sept 1.  At the time, all proposals had to pass by Absolute Majority to execute.  This meant more than 50% of total voting power in the NNS had to be cast to Adopt.  The only way this could happen was for DF and ICA to cast votes that executed liquid democracy.  Therefore, the policy was that DF and ICA would wait until the final hour of the voting period and they would cast their vote on the side of the majority of community votes.  Of course, this has the intended effect of decentralization, but was really just a temporary solution.  

On Nov 8, a Simple Majority voting mechanism with a Wait for Quiet feature was implemented.  Simple Majority means that the vote is decided by the majority of votes cast, but can only pass if at least 3% of total voting power votes to Adopt.  The Wait for Quiet feature extends the voting period if the vote results swing back and forth.  This prevents large token holders from waiting until the last moment to cast their vote and swinging the vote by surprise.  Since the Simple Majority voting mechanism was implemented, DF and ICA have been able to intentionally abstain from voting on governance proposals.  This prevents them from being the arbiters of governance decisions, but they still retain the capability of casting votes with liquid democracy.

Since DF and ICA have been abstaining from governance proposals, voting participation has been relatively low with an average around 5-10% of total voting power among 36 governance motion proposals.  Some of the more popular proposals have 15% voter participation.  Proposal 34485 was intended to completely remove DF and ICA from being the arbiters of governance decisions by default and to incentivize higher voter participation.  When it gets implemented, then the promise of higher voting rewards should encourage higher voter participation.  These tokenomics features should help ensure decentralized decisions that are in the long term best interest of the internet computer.

Please take action to configure your neuron to follow a trusted neuron on the Governance topic so you do not miss out on voting rewards when proposal 34485 is implemented.                                                                                                                                                      This is the 5th proposal in a 30 day series of Governance motion proposals that will be submitted to the NNS. So far, 1 proposal has been approved and the other 3 proposals are leaning heavily toward approval at this time.  These proposals each describe something educational about IC governance.  The action that is requested with these proposals is for you to demonstrate participation in governance by voting.  The neurons that vote will get voting rewards whether or not these proposals are adopted or rejected.  Please vote so you can maximize your voting rewards.  A goal of submitting these daily proposals is for voter participation to increase significantly on Governance topics.  For more information, please visit the forum topic linked below.  

It can be a lot of work and it is sometimes inconvenient to get notified, read, and vote on proposals every day.  Our lives are busy and it is impossible to keep up with everything, which means it can be easy to miss some proposals if you plan to vote manually.  For most proposals it is probably acceptable to delegate your vote to someone else.  This is what happens when you configure a Followee(s) for specific categories for your neuron.  Your neuron will cast a vote according to the Absolute Majority of the Followee(s) that you configure on each topic.  It is advisable to pick Followee(s) that you trust to vote in your best interest and that will be reliable to always vote.

Any time a neuron casts a vote, all downstream followers will simultaneously cast their votes according to the rules of Absolute Majority for each respective neuron in the chain.  This is commonly referred to as liquid democracy.  ICA and DF have a lot of followers, so when they cast votes a very large fraction of the voting power in the NNS will also cast votes.  However, they don’t vote on Governance Motion proposals or RegisterKnownNeuron proposals.  They want to ensure decentralized decisions on those types of proposals.

There will be situations in the future when you want to ensure that you cast your vote manually instead of letting your Followees cast your vote for you.  However, there is no way to guarantee when your Followee(s) will vote and if your Followee(s) vote first, then your vote cannot currently be reversed.  However, motion proposal 38985 passed on 11 Jan, 2022 and it is intended to enable you to vote manually any time during the voting period of the proposal.  It will likely be implemented in 2Q 2022.

It is important for decentralized governance of the IC that many organizations offer publicly known Followee neurons.  If you are part of an organization that you believe can be trusted by others to follow, then please post your neuronID and organization information as a comment on the forum (link provided below).  I would like to include it in a future daily proposal that helps the community identify known public neurons.  Also, if you want to be listed as a named Followee in the NNS dApp, then please consider submitting a RegisterKnownNeuron proposal for voting by the IC governing body. 

This is the 6th proposal in a 30 day series of Governance motion proposals that will be submitted to the NNS. So far, 2 proposals have been approved and the other 3 proposals are leaning heavily toward approval at this time.  These proposals each describe something educational about IC governance.

# Release Notes:
* Disable canister sandboxing, applied on top of a094b965
                      Update subnet io67a-2jmkw-zup3h-snbwi-g6a5n-rm5dn-b6png-lvdpl-nqnto-yih6l-gqe to replica version a094b965e20a920c838b611c4e2303ef428e56d8

Motivation: Upgrade the subnet 6 (io67a) to rc--2022-02-03_18-31
                                                    Instructions are provided below if you don’t know how to set your Followees for your neuron.

For neurons that were created with the NNS dApp:
Login to nns.ic0.app and select the Neuron tab
Select the neuron that you want to configure
Scroll down to the section titled Following and click Edit Followees
In the popup, select Governance and select Add Followee
Select one of the named Followees or enter the ID of another neuron you prefer to follow
It will take a few seconds to set the new Followee
Repeat for as many Followees that you prefer

For seed investors and neurons that were created using DFX or Quill, there is an easy way to use the NNS dApp to manage Followees.  This is accomplished by adding an internet identity principal to the neuron hot key list using quill.  This only needs to happen once.  Then you can log in to nns.ic0.app and configure your Followee as described above in the NNS dApp section.
The quill commands below must be executed via command line:
$ quill --pem-file <path-to-pem> neuron-manage <neuronID> --add-hot-key <principleID> > message.json
$ quill send message.json

More detailed instructions can be found on the IC wiki linked below including instructions on how to issue the Send command if you have an air-gapped setup. 
https://wiki.internetcomputer.org/wiki/ICP_staking_with_seed_phrase_and_air-gapped_computer

You are free to configure your Followees any way you like, but for most people a best practice is to set either DF or ICA as the Followee for All Topics and then set some other neuron(s) that you trust to vote on all Governance topics as you Followee for the Governance topic.

This is the 7th proposal in a 30 day series of Governance motion proposals that will be submitted to the NNS. So far, 2 proposals have been approved and the other 4 proposals are leaning heavily toward approval at this time.  These proposals each describe something educational about IC governance.

     The most common place to deliberate governance proposals is on the forum.  It is a place where anyone can go to understand the purpose of a proposal, what actions are being considered, offer your opinion, and learn from others in the community.  A link is provided below to the specific topic that describes this 30 day governance proposal campaign.  Please feel free to join the discussion.

https://forum.dfinity.org/t/proposals-to-increase-voting-participation-on-governance-topics/10706

This is the 8th proposal in a 30 day series of Governance motion proposals that will be submitted to the NNS. So far, 4 proposals have been approved and the other 3 proposals are leaning heavily toward approval at this time.  These proposals each describe something educational about IC governance.  The action that is requested with these proposals is for you to demonstrate participation in governance by voting.  The neurons that vote will get voting rewards whether or not these proposals are adopted or rejected.  Please vote so you can maximize your voting rewards.  A goal of submitting these daily proposals is for voter participation to increase significantly on Governance topics.  For more information, please visit the deliberation on the forum topic linked below.

                                      There have been 8 proposals so far in the daily governance proposal series that are intended to help highlight our current voter participation rate and encourage higher voter turnout.  Voter participation has been very consistent at 11.4 - 11.7 % of total voting power casting their votes including the four that have been executed and the four that are currently open.  It seems this active voting body only needs 24 hours to cast their votes.  Of the 47M votes that have been cast on average, somewhere around 5 - 6 M can be attributed to liquid democracy that is executed when the current publicly known neurons (cycledao, ICPMN, and ICDevs) cast their votes.  These public neurons have not missed a vote yet.  The rest of the votes cast seem to come from either large token holders or private neuron communities because there seem to be large chunks of votes that get cast.  I think it is safe to say that the first 8 days represent a baseline voter turnout from active governance participants today.  It will be very interesting to see if this participation rate changes when proposal 34485 is finally implemented.  There is a lot of upward potential for increased voting rewards for current active participants since 88% of total voting power is not voting on governance proposals.  The hypothesis is that changing the weights of proposals by topic will incentivize higher participation rates.  That would be really good for decentralization if it becomes reality.

This means your neuron will vote Yes on a proposal when greater than 50% of your Followees vote Yes and it will vote No when greater than or equal to 50% of your Followees vote No. This is really important to understand. If neither condition is met, then your neuron will Abstain.
 
The example below is intended to highlight the point for 4 Followees:
If 3 or 4 Followees vote Yes then your neuron will vote Yes
If 2, 3, or 4 Followees vote No then your neuron will vote No
If 2 Followees vote Yes and 1 Followee votes No, then your neuron will Abstain
 
The All Topics category is a catch all that will cover any category where you have not specified a Followee. If you have specified Followees for a given topic such as Governance, then they will decide your neurons vote for that category and the Followee designation you have for All Topics is not relevant to that topic.
 
For more information regarding the purpose of these daily governance proposals, please visit the deliberation on the forum topic linked below.

https://forum.dfinity.org/t/proposals-to-increase-voting-participation-on-governance-topics/10706                                                                                                                                             You can vote manually for specific proposals in the NNS dApp even if you configure Followees for All Topics or individual topics.  Just go to the Voting tab and select the Open proposal.  Scroll down and select Adopt or Reject.  If you vote manually, it will override your Followees.  You can only vote manually if you vote before your Followees vote.

It is also important to note that if you have any Followee designated for a specific topic, they will override your designations of Followee for All Topics when voting for proposals with that specific topic.  In other words, your designation for Followee for All Topics is ignored if you have one or more Followee designated for a specific topic such as Governance.  The All Topics designation only applies to topics where you have no Followee designated for that topic.

If you typically vote manually on governance proposals,there are filters built into the NNS dApp that can help you identify what proposals still need your vote.  On the Voting tab in the NNS dApp, you can select Accepting Votes under Reward Status and you can select Open under Proposal Status.  There is also a check box under the Proposal Status section that removes proposals from the list if you have already voted.

When you set Followees in any category, your neuron votes according to the rules of Absolute Majority. This means your neuron will vote Yes on a proposal when greater than 50% of your Followees vote Yes and it will vote No when greater than or equal to 50% of your Followees vote No. This is really important to understand. If neither condition is met, then your neuron will Abstain.  

The example below is intended to highlight the point for 2 Followees:
If 2 Followees vote Yes then your neuron will vote Yes.  
If 1 or 2 Followees vote No then your neuron will vote No.  
However,  
If 1 Followee votes Yes and 1 Followee Abstains, then your neuron will Abstain.

### Proposer: Dfinity Foundation
### Git Hash: bd95c0f9a9c8e04c7124e98f3d12c8dd9cae1681
### New Wasm Hash: c15bcaf7c75b4073cb8f8fcdeff55f23d7c84cd225340da191ac9fb0629d9d24
### Target canister: rrkah-fqaaa-aaaaa-aaaaq-cai

---

## Release Notes

### New features:
* Enable automatic node provider remuneration. From now on, node providers are remunerated based on their node participation as stipulated by the registry.
* Allow to change the routing table via proposal

### Improvements
*  Introduce voting reward weights in different topics, and prevent following from “All Topics” to kick in for the Governance Topic.
    NOTE: This will require users to either vote manually on Governance topic proposals (like motion proposals) or to follow a neuron directly in this topic.

###
* Fix calculation of age, on merge neuron, for a few more edge cases. This should not affect any users.

       It appears that Dfinity Foundation is now implementing the code changes that were approved in proposal 34485 (see dashboard reference to proposal 44947 below).  There are two fundamental changes: a) disable default following for proposals on the governance topic and b) weigh the voting rewards based on the topic.  As previously discussed in daily governance proposal 42893, there will be a meaningful difference in voting rewards between neurons that vote on governance topics and neurons that do not vote on governance topics.  

Part “a” of proposal 34485 has another important feature that should be discussed and understood by the IC community.  It addresses the fact that, since genesis, the All Topics category has been a catch all for all topics including the Governance topic.  The default Followee for all new neurons is ICA for All Topics.  Hence, DF and ICA cannot cast votes for the Governance topic because that results in almost all voting power in the NNS casting votes via liquid democracy.  They prefer for Governance topics to be decided by the IC community and do not want to be arbiters of these Governance proposals.  Hence, in proposal 34485 the action is to separate the Governance topic from the All Topics catch all.  This is another big step toward a decentralized governance system.  

This change also enables DF and ICA to cast votes from neurons 27 and 28, respectively, on Governance proposals moving forward without being the arbiters of the proposal.  I have no reason to believe they plan to vote on Governance proposals (their record has been to consistently abstain), but they would be able to vote without immediately ending a proposal by the rules of Absolute Majority because of this change.  Just like everyone else that has voting power in the NNS, both DF and ICA have the right to vote according to what they believe is in the long term best interest of the IC on Governance proposals.  

This is the 13th proposal in a 30 day series of Governance motion proposals that will be submitted to the NNS. So far, 8 proposals have been approved and the other 4 proposals are leaning heavily toward approval at this time.  These proposals each describe something educational about IC governance.  The action that is requested with these proposals is for you to demonstrate participation in governance by voting.  The neurons that vote will get voting rewards whether or not these proposals are adopted or rejected.  Please vote so you can maximize your voting rewards.  A goal of submitting these daily proposals is for voter participation to increase significantly on Governance topics.  For more information, please visit the deliberation on the forum topic linked below.

                 ## Summary:

Updating Internet Identity to commit d772441826c3e21af320108f5a2079006819f10e

## Rationale:

This includes an updated badge ("powered by crypto") with logo.

Additionally, there are improvements for developers:
* nicer rendering of the dummy captcha
* introduced `USE_DUMMY_AUTH` build switch to facilitate automated testing (e.g. with Selenium) without having to deal with WebAuthn

Detailed list of changes since last release:

        This topic seems like an important reminder since voting rewards will change starting today.  In order to maximize voting rewards, neuron owners will need to either vote manually or configure their neurons with a trusted Followee for the Governance topic (in addition to All Topics Except Governance).  There are currently 3 organizations who have made it publicly known that they offer their neuron as a trusted Followee to the IC community.  Links are provided below to published information where you can learn more about the organizations.

It is important for decentralized governance of the IC that many organizations offer publicly known Followee neurons.  If you are part of an organization that you believe can be trusted by others to follow, then please post your neuronID and organization information as a comment on the forum (link provided below).  I would like to include it in a future daily proposal that helps the community identify known public neurons.  Also, if you want to be listed as a named Followee in the NNS dApp, then please consider submitting a RegisterKnownNeuron proposal for voting by the IC governing body.  

This is the 14th proposal in a 30 day series of Governance motion proposals that will be submitted to the NNS. So far, 9 proposals have been approved and the other 4 proposals are leaning heavily toward approval at this time.  These proposals each describe something educational about IC governance.  The action that is requested with these proposals is for you to demonstrate participation in governance by voting.  The neurons that vote will get voting rewards whether or not these proposals are adopted or rejected.  Please vote so you can maximize your voting rewards.  A goal of submitting these daily proposals is for voter participation to increase significantly on Governance topics.  For more information, please visit the deliberation on the forum topic linked below.

                                           Voting rewards have changed starting today.  System canister management proposal 44947 was the implementation of governance proposal 34485 and was implemented at 5:08 PM UTC yesterday.  There are two fundamental changes: a) disable default following for proposals on the governance topic and b) weigh the voting rewards based on the topic.  

Here are a few key points to note about the changes:  
1 - If you want to maximize voting rewards, then you must vote manually on Governance proposals or you must configure your neuron with a Followee that you trust for the Governance topic.  
2 - All public known neurons have already voted on current governance proposals, so if you are just now configuring your neurons for the Governance topic you will need to vote manually on the current governance proposals.  
3 - The new proposal topic weights went into effect yesterday late in the day.  Hence, the first full 24 hr period of voting rewards with the new weights will occur tomorrow.  
4 - The new proposal weights are permanent until they are changed by some future proposal  
5 - There will be a significant difference between voting rewards on days with governance proposals vs days that don’t have governance proposals.  
6 - The purpose of the proposal topic weights is to incentivize increased voter participation, especially on the Governance topic.  Currently only 11% of total voting power votes on Governance proposals.  That will probably go up due to attractive incentives to participate in Governance topics.  

This is the 15th proposal in a 30 day series of Governance motion proposals that will be submitted to the NNS. So far, 10 proposals have been approved and the other 4 proposals are leaning heavily toward approval at this time.  These proposals each describe something educational about IC governance.  The action that is requested with these proposals is for you to demonstrate participation in governance by voting.  The neurons that vote will get voting rewards whether or not these proposals are adopted or rejected.  Please vote so you can maximize your voting rewards.  A goal of submitting these daily proposals is for voter participation to increase significantly on Governance topics.

                               Today was the first day we saw the full impact of the new weights applied to NNS proposal topics.  If you voted for all proposals that were finalized yesterday, then you earned approx 115 - 130% annualized voting reward yield (8 year dissolve delay and 0 - 28 months neuron age).  If you voted for all proposals except the governance proposal, then you earned 8-10% annualized voting reward yield.  There will be a wide range of daily voting rewards moving forward depending on how many Governance and non Exchange Rate proposals are finalized each day.  

ICP is a governance token and the tokenonmics are intended to incentivize active participation.  High participation rates are necesary to achieve the most decentralized governance decisions possible.  The current participation rate on governance proposals is 11%, but hopefully the participation rates will start to increase with these new tokenomics incentives.  

This is the 16th proposal in a 30 day series of Governance motion proposals that will be submitted to the NNS.  These proposals each describe something educational about IC governance.  The action that is requested with these proposals is for you to demonstrate participation in governance by voting.  The neurons that vote will get voting rewards whether or not these proposals are adopted or rejected.  For more information, please visit the deliberation on the forum topic linked below.  You can also find all past daily governance proposals in this series on the dashboard.

                         If you have recently decided to configure one or more publicly known neurons as Followee for Governance topics, it is possible that you have still missed governance votes.  This is because the ICP Maximalist Network, cycledao.xyz, and ICDevs.org neurons have been voting within 24 hours on the daily governance proposals and Dfinity Foundation and Internet Computer Association have been abstaining from the daily governance proposals.  Even if your Followee has already voted, you can still vote manually using the procedure below.  

Log in to nns.ic0.app and go to the Voting tab.  Select only Governance under the Topics filter and select only Open under the Proposal Status filter.  You can also click the checkbox to hide proposals where you have already voted.  The proposals that remain in the list are the proposals that are still available for voting.  You should open them all and vote manually if needed.  

This proposal is being submitted earlier than normal today because proposal 44967 is currently expected to close within the next 1.5 hours.  There is still time to vote on that proposal as well as the 3 other governance proposals that are currently Open.  

This is the 17th proposal in a 30 day series of Governance motion proposals that will be submitted to the NNS.  These proposals each describe something educational about IC governance.  The action that is requested with these proposals is for you to demonstrate participation in governance by voting.  The neurons that vote will get voting rewards whether or not these proposals are adopted or rejected.  For more information, please visit the deliberation on the forum topic linked below.  You can also find all past daily governance proposals in this series on the dashboard.  There is a new IC Wiki that has been created to provide instructions on how to maximize voting rewards.

https://wiki.internetcomputer.org/wiki/Maximizing_Voting_and_NNS_Rewards              It can be helpful to think of the daily voting reward allocation as a pie that gets divided among all people who participate in governance.  The pie is divided in proportion to voting power as well as the quantity and weights of proposals that are settled on the previous day.  If you vote on all NNS proposals, then you get your piece of the pie.  If you don’t vote on some of the NNS proposals, then other people who do vote get to split your piece of the pie.  

Make sure your neuron is configured to vote on all proposals if you want to maximize voting rewards.  If you noticed that your voting rewards have gone down in the last few days, then you are not voting on Governance topics.  You can maximize voting rewards by voting manually or by configuring your neuron with a Followee on the Governance topic that you can trust to vote on all governance proposals.  For example, ICP Maximalist Network, cycledao.xyz, and ICdevs.org have all voted on all daily governance proposals.  

This is the 18th proposal in a 30 day series of Governance motion proposals that will be submitted to the NNS.  These proposals each describe something educational about IC governance.  The action that is requested with these proposals is for you to demonstrate participation in governance by voting.

If you are part of an organization that you believe can be trusted by others to follow, then please add your organization to the list of named Followees in the NNS dApp.  This can be accomplished by submitting a RegisterKnownNeuron proposal to the NNS for voting by the IC governing body.  The command for RegisterKnownNeuron can be found in the forum link below regarding Known Neuron.  Also, if you post your neuronID and organization information as a comment on the forum link provided below regarding this daily proposal series, then it will be included in a future daily proposal.  There is no better time than now to start making your neuron known.

This selection will apply to all proposal topics unless you designate a different Followee for the individual proposal topics.  If you designate a different Followee for individual proposal topics, then that designation will be used instead of the selection you make for All Topics Except Governance.  In order to vote on Governance topics, you must designate a Followee for Governance topics.  The selection you make for All Topics does not apply to Governance.  

What does this mean?  In order to vote on everything and maximize voting rewards (without voting manually), you must set a Followee for at least 2 categories: “Governance” and “All Topics Except Governance”.  If you do not configure Followees for both categories, then you will not maximize voting rewards (unless you vote manually).

Motivation: Upgrade the subnet 6 (io67a) to rc--2022-02-17_18-31
                                            There are two types of Governance proposals that can be made by the IC community…RegisterKnownNeuron and Motion proposals.  The RegisterKnownNeuron is the only type of NNS proposal at this time that the community can make that is automatically executed if it passes.  Motion proposals do not have any code that will execute if they pass because they are only text.  They are intended to be used to make the most important governance decisions, but the decisions that are made have to be implemented by the Dfinity Foundation.  At this time it is still unclear what the work process looks like for implementation and so far it seems to be handled on a case by case basis.  We will all figure in due time.  

Yet there have been many occasions when the Dfinity Foundation has encouraged the IC community to make governance proposals and they continue to take steps to enable that to happen.  The most recent example, of course, is the weighting system for the types of proposals that are submitted to the NNS.  Governance Proposals now have the highest weight and Exchange Rate proposals now have a significantly lower weight.  This means individuals now have incentives to ensure that they vote on all Governance proposals.  This also means the IC community has incentives to develop and submit governance proposals.  On days where Governance proposals do not settle, the voting rewards will be the lower amount we were used to prior to the proposal weights.  If we want higher voting rewards for governance participation, then we must actively engage in submitting meaningful proposals.  

Proposals need to accomplish some important task for the IC ecosystem.  As an example, the purpose of this 30 day governance proposal campaign has been to educate the community on the need to vote on Governance proposals and, hopefully, help facilitate an increase in the voting participation rate.  It remains to be seen if this campaign will be effective over the short duration that it will be completed. However, when it ends, there should be new, actionable proposals that are ready for submission to the NNS.  

Everyone has an opinion on various aspects of the IC ecosystem and is free to express those opinions on social media outlets.  However, the opinions that can be the most useful to the IC community are well presented, actionable, fully deliberated on the forum, and presented as an NNS governance proposal in a way that motivates the governing body to approve.  There is no requirement that governance proposals are major changes in the IC ecosystem.  It is reasonable for the scope of the proposal to be relatively moderate.  The point is that anyone in the IC community is free to submit a governance motion proposal any time for any reason.  However, if your proposal is Rejected you will lose 1 ICP and if it is Adopted your 1 ICP proposal fee will be returned.  The rewards could outweigh the risks.  

It should also be noted that it would be a mistake to submit garbage governance proposals because there will surely be someone who submits a proposal to put an end to poorly intended governance proposals.  If we want to continue to experience higher voting rewards that can be stimulated by the new proposal weighting system, then the governance proposal system cannot be abused.

This proposal is part of a 30 day series of Governance motion proposals that will be submitted to the NNS.  These proposals each describe something educational about IC governance.  The action that is requested with these proposals is for you to demonstrate participation in governance by voting.  The neurons that vote will get voting rewards whether or not these proposals are adopted or rejected.  For more information, please visit the deliberation on the forum topic linked below.

                                                            On 2/15, the new proposal weight system was implemented.  There were approx 47.4M votes cast on average for each of 14 daily governance proposals prior to that date.  However, since the change there have been 52.3M votes cast on average for each of the last 8 daily governance proposals.  This is a modest 10% increase in typical voter participation on governance proposals.  It remains to be seen if the trend in the upward direction will continue.

## Objective

Enable canisters to make HTTP requests

# Background

Canister smart contracts cannot make requests to HTTP/HTTPS services on the Internet by default. Doing so is a challenge on any blockchain caused by the fact that different replicas / nodes can (and will) receive different responses for the same call, be it, for example, for timestamps or ids contained in the response. Such different responses received by different replicas and further processing being based on those different responses on each replica would lead to a divergence of state on the different replicas and thus destroy the determinism property of the computation with the result that no consensus could be achieved. Thus, replicas cannot just make HTTP/HTTPS requests to outside services without creating a major problem for the subnet.

However, it is technically possible to enable canisters on the IC to safely make HTTP/HTTPS (henceforth just "HTTP") requests with an extension of the Internet Computer protocol. This feature discusses such extension to the Internet Computer protocol. We think that this is a crucial step towards better integrating the Internet Computer with the public Internet and thus breaking down so-far inherent borders that blockchains face. We think that opening up the Internet Computer to interface it with HTTP services on the Internet is a major step towards the future of the Internet Computer as a platform that can run general-purpose workloads and also for a more open, integrative, blockchain world at large.

Today, obtaining data from the outside world requires, as on any blockchain, the use of blockchain oracles, or oracles. However, oracles lead to a more complicated programming model, charge substantial fees, add complexity and indirections, and require additional trust assumptions to be made. Allowing canister code to directly make HTTP requests would remove the dependence on oracles and its disadvantages. Of course, oracles may still be useful for certain use cases when we have HTTP calling capabilities, but many use cases could be covered with direct HTTP calls.

Allowing canisters to make HTTP calls to services on the public Internet has long been a community-requested feature for the Internet Computer. It will give smart contract canisters the ability to autonomously connect to services on the Internet to retrieve or submit data and will thus enable a large range of additional or enhanced use cases, e.g., obtaining exchange rate data from external servers for DeFi applications, obtaining weather data for decentralized insurance services, or sending notifications to users via traditional communications channels, all without using oracles. HTTP support for canisters is one of the features on our strategic R&D initiative on "General Integration" (see https://forum.dfinity.org/t/long-term-r-d-general-integration-proposal/9383/4), thus we want to now proceed with launching a motion proposal for this feature and ask for community approval w.r.t. going forward. If accepted, a launch in the Q1 Chromium release is planned, meaning an aggressive timeline for our engineering teams.


# Goals and Requirements

This feature should enable canisters to directly make requests to HTTP URLs, using the GET method initially, and receive the corresponding response back into the state of the canister in a deterministic fashion. The functionality should be realized in a direct, trustless, way. Direct, trustless, integration is a common theme in other integrations of the IC, e.g., the Bitcoin integration that is to launch on mainnet in the near future. Direct integration means that we do not need to make any additional trust assumptions or involve any additional parties to realize the functionality.

For the first version, all replicas in the subnet will send out the request and return a response that goes through the IC Consensus mechanism. In the future, we may present an option for canister developers to reduce the size of the required quorum, so that even only one replica may make the request, if desired, but the guarantees on such request would be accordingly lower. Another future envisioned extension are POST requests. In combination with the reduced quorum, those can be of tremendous utility for many use cases where reliability of the calls is less important than compatibility with APIs out there.


# Proposed Design

We next outline the proposed design at a high level.


## System API (Management Canister)

We implement a system API in the Management Canister that provides a method for making an HTTP/HTTPS call to an outside service and receiving back a response. See below for the original proposal w.r.t. the API and note that not all community feedback from the discussions in this forum topic have not been included here yet.


```
type http_header = record { 0: text; 1: text };

type http_response = record {
  status: nat;
  headers: vec http_header;
  body: blob;
};


type http_request_error = variant {
  no_consensus;
  timeout;
  bad_tls;
  invalid_url;
  transform_error;
  dns_error;
  unreachable;
  conn_timeout;
};
```

**New method in ic0:**


```
  http_request : (record {
    url : text;
    method : variant { get };
    headers: vec http_header;
    body : opt blob;
    transform : opt variant {
      function: func (http_response) -> (http_response) query
    };
  }) -> (variant { Ok : http_response; Err: opt http_request_error });
```

See the (draft) PR on the interface specification repository, which is now public, for details regarding the proposed API and related discussions: https://github.com/dfinity/interface-spec/pull/7/files.


## High-Level Request and Response Flow

Calling this API will store the request in a specific area of replicated state that is periodically read by a component at the networking / consensus layer. This component, once it sees a new request, provides this request to an HTTP Adapter at the networking layer which performs the actual request and provides a response in return.

Responses are put into a new HTTP Artifact Pool, are signed by the replica to endorse the response, and the signature is gossiped to all replicas in the subnet. Once a request has support by at least 2/3 of the replicas of the subnet in the view of the current block making replica, it adds this endorsed response to an IC block that is going through Consensus. Because at least 2/3 of the replicas of the subnet have supported the response, it is ensured that the subnet can achieve consensus on it.

Once the IC block with the HTTP response has made it through the IC consensus layer, it is routed back to the system API and is provided back to the calling canister, which concludes the original API call for making an HTTP request.

We do not go into the details of the error handling. In short, it is possible, as error scenarios, that requests time out or cannot be consented on, in which case a corresponding error response is generated and returned in response to the request.

## Handling Differences in Responses

Many HTTP-based services like API providers include fine-granular timestamps or unique ids into their responses, implying that it would not be possible to achieve consensus on the responses received by the different replicas in the subnet. This can be addressed by allowing the caller to specify a response processing function to be performed on the responses before they are provided to the consensus layer. This allows for a much broader field of application for the feature by allowing a broader class of responses to obtain consensus on.

The canister may specify a response processing method that, when a response is received by each replica, is applied on the response on each replica to transform it accordingly into a response that is intended to be the same on each replica and thereby will be accepted by the IC consensus mechanism.

The transformation may, for example, only keep specific fields from the responses, while removing other values that might differ across responses, such as timestamps or unique identifiers. The transformation can also just retain a single value of interest from the whole response, e.g., an exchange rate value, which would substantially reduce the required IC "block bandwidth".

The design choice to expose a canister method to perform the transformation and not do the transformation directly in replica code has multiple reasons behind it:

* The computational effort for the transformation can be directly accounted for through consuming the cycles of a canister. Thereby certain kinds of denial of service attacks that would be possible and would need to be addressed for a replica implementation are not possible.

* It is fully flexible in terms of which transformations can be implemented. Implementations in replica code would use a specific approach, e.g., a templating language, for defining the transformation.

A drawback of the approach of exposing a canister method for the transformation instead of an alternative considered design of allowing for a set of transformation types parameterized by a template as input to the method call is that it may be slightly more effort on the side of the canister author to implement the canister method. However, the tradeoffs have been considered substantially in favour of the approach of exposing a canister method, as in the other approach it would be difficult to charge for the transformation effort and to prevent DoS attacks using long-running transformations.


# Roadmap

We plan, assuming a supportive community vote, to build the feature to be ready for a release around the end of Q1 / 2022. We propose a design and scope that is reasonable to implement for a first MVP as outlined in this motion proposal to trigger further discussions and support a community vote.

The implementation cuts through all the layers of the IC protocol stack and thus requires tight collaboration between the core IC engineering teams. Most engineering effort is expected on the consensus layer, next are networking, execution, and message routing in descending order of effort. In order to meet the tight timeline to a Q1 release, the different teams will work in parallel as far as reasonably possible.

In order to ensure the high quality of the feature, we will perform extensive automated testing in our system testing environment and a security review.


# Extensions

The envisioned feature implementation is a first MVP that provides the core functionality of allowing canisters to make HTTP requests. We have already identified some enhancements that have been decided to not be implemented as part of the first release, but that we can realize as separate features in the future.

* **POST/PUT requests:** Those would be pretty similar in terms of implementation assuming idempotency of the requests. Not assuming this inherently requires us to use a reduced quorum of size 1 to emulate traditional POST/PUT calls or to extend the called API such that it can handle multiple requests for the same POST/PUT to be done and execute them only once.

* **Customizable quorum (unsafe requests):** This allows the canister to specify the quorum size to make a tradeoff between performance, resource consumption, and compatibility with traditional HTTP-based servers on the one hand and security on the other hand. The most relevant reduced quorum size in practice will be quorum size 1. This extension, together with the possibility of making POST/PUT requests will enable another large array of use cases without making changes to external services.

* **Persistent connections:** This is an extension purely for better performance, and thus left as an extension instead of implementing it already as part of the MVP.

* **Different numerical response values:** Some APIs will result in slightly different response values if called at slightly different times. The latter is typically the case in the setting of all replicas making the same call to a service. A further extension to the feature can allow for such different received numerical response values to be consented on and being returned in appropriate form, e.g., their median or all values are returned so that the calling canister can directly receive or apply an appropriate function to determine the "actual" response value.



## What we are asking the community:

                            It was interesting to see that a lot more votes were cast on some of the Open governance proposals today.  For the most recent Settled proposals, the total vote count was approx 54M.  The average is now 60.4M on the 6 proposals that have been Open for more than 24 hours. Since the baseline at the beginning of the daily governance proposal campaign was 47.4M votes cast on average, the current voting participation has increased by approx 27%.  The participation rate on governance proposals is still only 14.8%, so neurons that vote continue to see high daily voting rewards and neurons that do not vote continue to see low daily voting rewards.  Hopefully the increased participation trend continues so we can achieve optimal decentralized decisions on governance proposals.  

For anyone who does not have time to cast votes on these governance proposals, you always have the option of configuring a trusted Followee for Governance proposals so they can vote on your behalf according to our system of liquid democracy.  There are currently 3 organizations who have made it publicly known that they offer their neuron as a trusted Followee to the IC community.

                                              It’s easy to think that a few whales are in control of NNS governance decisions, especially when DF and ICA have historically abstained from voting on governance proposals.  However, higher voter participation rates make it less likely that a few people are in control.  A proposal ended today with 71.2M votes that were cast.  That’s 17.4% of total voting power, which is the highest voter turnout on governance proposals since the Simple Majority voting mechanic went into effect.  While it is true that there are whales in the ICP ecosystem, the votes that are cast do not accumulate instantly via liquid democracy.  Votes cast over time on individual proposals have the appearance that there are many people voting on these proposals.  Voter participation rates are definitely increasing.  Hence, the idea that whales control governance decisions is losing credibility and the idea that NNS decisions are becoming more decentralized is gaining credibility.

If you find the process complicated, then reach out for help.

Interestingly, Dfinity Foundation and Internet Computer Association both cast votes on all the Open governance proposals today.  I’m grateful that they voted Yes on all.  More importantly, it’s good to see that they are willing to participate in governance and that they no longer execute the Absolute Majority voting mechanic when they vote on Governance proposals.  They certainly cast a lot of votes via liquid democracy, but it is unclear how much of that voting power is owned by the organizations and how much is owned by neurons that have intentionally configured DF and/or ICA on the Governance topic.  We now have an example of over 40.2% participation in voting on governance proposals.

One type of investor that might find it difficult to set Followees for their neurons is seed investors.  Anyone who manages a neuron using DFX and Quill can easily add an internet identity principal as a hotkey to each neuron.  Once you set up hotkey control, you can manage Followees, manually vote on proposals, and increase neuron stake using the NNS dApp.  This makes those tasks very easy.

The Quill commands below must be executed via command line:  
$ quill --pem-file <path-to-pem> neuron-manage <neuronID> --add-hot-key <principleID> > message.json  
$ quill send message.json

Three sections of the website are interesting from a governance perspective including Governance, Neurons, and Circulation. On the Governance page, you can look up all current and past proposals including title, summary, proposal status, votes cast, etc.  The proposal information on these pages has live links.  Hence, even though you cannot click links in the proposals on the NNS dApp, you can always go to the dashboard and click the links.  The easiest way to find proposals is to enter the proposal number in the search bar.  If you want to see a list of all Governance proposals, then go to the Governance tab and filter for Governance in the Topics column.  If you search for neuronID, then you can see how that neuron voted on each proposal in the past.  Basically, the Dashboard is a useful place to DYOR with a lot of information about the IC ecosystem.

The forum is used for a lot of different types of discussions on anything related to the IC, but two sections that are most relevant to governance include Governance and Roadmap topics.  This website is where you can stay informed and get involved in deliberation.  The typical process for submitting a proposal has been to post a new topic on the forum in the Governance category before submitting the actual proposal.  This topic typically includes the text that will be used in the NNS proposal along with an explanation that justifies the proposal.  Deliberation typically will occur for 1-2 weeks and sometimes the author will revise the proposal based on feedback from the community during deliberation.  Everyone in the IC community is invited to participate in the conversation on the forum.

                              This proposal is Actionable.  Please read and vote accordingly.  

This is a formal proposal to end the 30 day governance proposal campaign early.  If this proposal is Approved, then there will be no more daily governance proposals submitted as per the campaign described on the forum topic 10706 linked below.  If it is Rejected, then the proposal campaign will continue until the 30 day campaign is completed.  The daily proposals will be put on hold until this vote concludes.  

https://forum.dfinity.org/t/proposals-to-increase-voting-participation-on-governance-topics/10706  

Recent discussions on the forum have surfaced valid concerns that the IC community should consider regarding abuse of the proposal weighting system.  An actionable suggestion was made that this 30 day governance proposal campaign should end, so it is being put to a vote with this proposal.  Feel free to voice your opinion on the forum linked above.

The daily governance proposal campaign has been ongoing for 27 days.  All proposals have been educational regarding governance participation and all of these proposals have been approved so far.  For the first 15 days there were negligible effects on voting rewards.  For the last 12 days voting rewards have changed significantly.  This proposal campaign has a functional purpose, which is to increase awareness, educate the community, and help facilitate an increase in governance participation. A desired outcome has been to improve decentralization of IC governance decisions by increasing voter turnout on governance proposals.  There has been a sizable increase in voting participation over this time period, so it can be considered a success in its current state without needing to complete the final 3 days of the campaign.

# Release Notes:
* Disable canister sandboxing
                                                   ## Objective

This motion proposal is to request Dfinity to prioritize creating an index or list of all neuron ID values, accessible through the Candid Interface.

## Background

A newly created neuron is given a random neuron id that can be up to 17-digits long (up to 10 quadrillion). Currently, there is no list of neuron IDs that have been created. The result of this is that it is impractical for any person or entity to know of all neurons created on the NNS, significantly hampering transparency into the NNS.

# Why this is important

Transparency into the NNS is vital for understanding governance and investor behavior.  It is important to know: how many ICP are staked in the NNS and what the staking behavior is in order for governance participants and investors to make informed decisions.  A failure to provide transparency could lead to mistrust of the NNS and dissuade potential investments into the Internet Computer.

## Community conversation

This topic was discussed in the forum at: https://forum.dfinity.org/t/motion-request-for-neuron-indexing/11183

The conversation focused on the perceived benefits of:
- Increased transparency into the NNS, including full awareness of how many ICP are staked, dissolve delay and age bonuses, recent voting behavior of all neurons.
- Increased trust in the NNS through transparency of voting power.
- Reduction in asymmetric information of the NNS.

The perceived risks of this change, per the forum dissccion are:
- Reduction in privacy for neuron holders
- Does not follow capability-based access

# Objective

## The Problem

Those with ICP staked in neurons face two main challenges when dealing with the maturity they earn as a result of voting rewards:

- How to avoid incurring a tax burden;
- How to compound maturity with the least manual effort.

## Proposed Changes

The objective of this proposal is to address these concerns by making several changes to the way maturity is handled by the NNS governance canister:

1. There will be two types of maturity:

   a. **staked maturity**, which contributes to voting power, but no ICP is produced from this maturity until the neuron is dissolved; and
   b. **maturity**, which can be staked, used to produce ICP, or _traded in for stake_ (see below) once it is received.

2. Daily voting rewards may be received either as staked maturity or maturity, and this choice can be changed _for future rewards_ at any time. Note that if rewards are received as staked maturity, this has the same effect as compounding rewards daily.

3. When ICP is produced from maturity, this can take place in one of two ways:

   a. If there is sufficient staked ICP in the neuron, maturity can be _traded in_ by exchanging an equal amount of staked ICP for staked maturity. For example: If a neuron has 100 staked ICP, 0 staked maturity and 10 maturity, the result of a _trade in_ would yield 10 ICP and leave the neuron with 90 staked ICP, 10 staked maturity and 0 maturity. Note that this has may have tokenomics implications described in more detail in the _Impact on Tokenomics_ section.

   b. If there is not sufficient staked ICP in the neuron, newly minted ICP is produced.

4. ICP is produced from staked maturity only when the neuron is disbursed, at which point it is subject the _modulation_ described below.

5. Whenever ICP is produced from maturity by minting, it is subject to a mandatory 7 day waiting period followed by a modulation of the amount received, up to +/- 5%, based on the recent market price of ICP. How this is calculated is described in the section _Modulated production of ICP from maturity_ below.

## Rationale

It is hoped that these changes will improve the tax situation for neuron holders based on the fact that, when ICP is produced from maturity, it is unknown how much ICP will result; and also because this process may be change in the future based on governance proposals. A neuron with compounding maturity will have no definite future value.

# Neuron management changes

It may be helpful to explain how management of neurons will be changed by this proposal, using a set of examples.

## `merge_maturity` → `stake_maturity`

Merge maturity is now called _stake maturity_, and simply converts `maturity` into `staked_maturity`.

### Before proposed change:

- Before `merge_maturity`: Neuron has 100 ICP stake and 10 maturity.
- After `merge_maturity`: Neuron has 110 ICP stake and 0 maturity.

### After proposed change

- Before `stake_maturity`: Neuron has 100 ICP stake, 0 staked maturity and 10 maturity.
- After `stake_maturity`: Neuron has 100 ICP stake 10 staked maturity and 0 maturity.

## `spawn_maturity` → `disburse_maturity`

Spawn maturity is now called _disburse maturity_. This operation begins a 7 day clock that completes with a modulation of the amount to be received (see below). This final amount of newly minted ICP may then be transferred into the account of a neuron holder.

### Before proposed change:

- Before `spawn_maturity`: Neuron has 100 ICP stake and 10 maturity.
- After `spawn_maturity`: Neuron has 100 ICP stake and 0 maturity, while a newly created reward neuron has 10 ICP stake and 0 maturity.

### After proposed change

- Before `disburse_maturity`: Neuron has 100 ICP stake, 0 staked maturity and 10 maturity.
- After `disburse_maturity`: Neuron has 100 ICP stake 0 staked maturity and 0 maturity. After 7 days, between 9.5 and 10.5 ICP is transferred to the accunt of the user.

## `exchange_maturity`

If there is sufficient staked ICP in the neuron, this operation exchanges maturity for staked ICP in the neuron, while converting that maturity into staked maturity.

### Example

- Before `exchange_maturity`: Neuron has 100 ICP stake, 0 staked maturity and 10 maturity.
- After `exchange_maturity`: Neuron has 90 ICP stake 10 staked maturity and 0 maturity. 10 ICP is immediately transferred to the user account.

## split_neuron

The meaning of this operation is more accurately _split neuron stake_.

When a neuron is split, its staked maturity is also split according to the same percentage. Any maturity, or currently disbursing maturity, remains in the parent neuron.

## merge_neurons

When neurons are merged, all stake is merged, all staked maturity is merged, and all maturity is merged. Any maturity in the source neuron that is waiting to produce ICP (meaning, completing its 7 day waiting period) will remain, and be transferred to the user account when the waiting period ends, according to the modulation factor described below.

# Proposed changes to the governance canister

To meet the objectives stated above, the followed changes will be made to governance.

## Change 1: Staked maturity

Each neuron presently has an amount of ICP staked and an amount of maturity earned. In order to introduce the idea of _staked maturity_ as separate from _maturity_, the two amounts will be tracked separately.

## Change 2: Auto-compounding

Once there are two separate kind of maturity, a flag is provided to decide which is increased when rewards are granted. This flag may be changed at any time.

## Change 3: Disburse directly from the neuron

In the past a separate reward neuron was used to manage the _7 day delay_ required when spawning. Instead, we would like to find a mechanism that allows for disbursing actions to take place within a single neuron only. The exact mechanics are still being designed.

## Change 4: Trading-in staked ICP

While a neuron contains staked ICP, maturity may be traded in without any minting and thus no new income. To compensate the loss of staked ICP, the same amount is added to the `staked_maturity` so that no voting power is lost. See the example above for `exchange_maturity`.

This means that if rewards are harvested regularly from a neuron, it will eventually contain only stake maturity -- which behaves exactly like the original staked ICP in terms of voting power and future rewards. The primary difference is when the neuron is finally dissolved and disbursed, the amount of ICP received is subject to modulation according to change 5.

## Change 5: Modulated production of ICP

Whenever newly minted ICP is produced from maturity, the amount actually
minted is modulated to take recent price movements into account. The algorithm
used to do this is as follows:

  1. Determine the 30 day moving average for each of the last 28 days. Label these `a₁` (today) through `a₂₈`.

  2. Compute the average price delta for each of the last four weeks. Thus, `d₁ = (a₁ - a₇) / a₇`, etc. This value is bounded from `-0.05` to `0.05` by clipping values to the limits of this range.

  3. Take the average of these adjusted deltas: `(d₁ + d₂ + d₃ + d₄) / 4`.

The resulting value is a number between `-0.05` to `0.05` that determines the percentage change of the modulation. This is multiplied by the maturity to determine the amount of ICP that should be minted.

# Impact on security

There should be no security implications from this change.

# Impact on simplicity

There are a few ways in which this proposal affects the simplicity of staking ICP in a neuron:

1. Reward neurons are no longer needed to disburse maturity. This is managed within each neuron itself.

2. There are now two kinds of maturity to be aware of: staked maturity and regular maturity.

3. There is a new flag (a checkbox in the UI) to decide which type of maturity rewards are received as. Choosing _staked maturity_ is equivalent to a neuron that automatically compounds daily.

4. The modulation of maturity that occurs before minting is the largest source of complexity in this proposal. It remains to be seen what effect this will actually have on tax authorities, and whether the algorithm employed should be refined in the future.

# Impact on tokenomics

This proposal will impact tokenomics in several ways.

## Deferring inflation

The most immediate effect is that over the next several years the minting rate, or increase in supply, will drop to much lower numbers, as the majority of disbursed maturity is transferred out of the staked ICP of a neuron rather than minting new ICP. This also means that when these neurons finally dissolve, the minting that was deferred will happen then. The intent is that this will happen at a time when burn rates are established and can better absorb the increase in supply.

## Less forced selling

At present, tax authorities may consider maturity to be income the moment it is received. In such situations, there is a constant pressure to frequently realize maturity as ICP and to sell some part of it on the open market. This is both inflationary and increases selling pressure. By removing the need to constantly produce ICP from maturity there is less forced selling on the market and more freedom to wait until market conditions are favorable and better able to absorb the incoming ICP.

## Improved return in the initial years

If a neuron is staked for multiple years, any income generated by that neuron, at the beginning of its dissolve delay, will be in the form of staked maturity and not newly minted ICP. This happens because stake is paid out in exchange for staked maturity, as described above. What this means for stake holders is that they will not need to sell for taxes during this initial phase, so all of that ICP can be re-staked to increase voting power, which increases overall returns.

## Further price stability

The next effect is that neuron holders with available maturity could be incentivized to produce and sell ICP when prices have been trending upward, and not when the market for ICP has been recently falling. The potential lifting of tax burden due to this uncertainty is what would permit this freedom of choice.

# Alternatives considered

Several alternative modulation algorithms were considered, including a more simple price delta algorithm, one based on a 30-day linear regression slope, and even one using price/volume trends. The algorithm chosen above was analyzed by calculating the modulation it would have yielded over the current history of ICP prices.

The choice of algorithm, and the bounding factor of +/- 5%, should at present be regarded as an experiment. Without real market experience to observe the economic impact, it is impossible to foreknow the perfect algorithm for inducing uncertainty while at the same time reflecting overall market trends.

# Security Patch Policy and Procedure

The DFINITY Security team and R&D team are proposing an open policy and procedure for handling high-risk security patches of the IC. 

This was previously posted on February 22, 2022: https://forum.dfinity.org/t/feedback-wanted-security-patch-policy-and-procedure/11069


## Background

Openness is a top priority for the DFINITY Foundation. The community’s participation in shaping and governing the Internet Computer is an important driver for its success. This is evident from the series of open-sourcing efforts that took place following the Genesis event and the foundation’s efforts to shape the governance system into an instrument for community participation. As a result, All changes to the Internet Computer platform, including changes and upgrades to the system canisters, are subjected to a proposal and voting process that keeps the community updated and enables members to discuss, approve, and reject proposed changes as well as verify them against the codebase in the open-sourced repository. But in the case of security patches, they are extremely sensitive by nature, and knowledge of a patch can provide a window of opportunity for an adversary to mount an attack on the system before it has been patched. So depending on the severity and exploitability of the known vulnerability in the system, it won’t always be feasible to develop the patch in the open and it becomes important to limit the exposure of the patch while it is being developed and applied to the platform. As a result, this policy is the manifestation of how the DFINITY Foundation best thinks it can address security vulnerabilities and protect all the users, stakeholders, and systems while keeping the development of the Internet Computer transparent. Given this document gets accepted by the community through an NNS motion proposal, the following policy will be adopted by the DFINITY Foundation for patching all the high severity vulnerabilities.


1. Due to the sensitive nature of security patches, the foundation will not make the content of security patches public until the entire system has been patched.

2. As with any other upgrades, a proposal will be submitted for the community to vote on, aka “bless”, a new version of the artifact. The proposal will contain the checksum of the Internet Computer deployment artifacts. But the main difference is that the community won’t be able to verify the checksum as the code is not yet published. 

3. The details of the patch will be revealed after a quiet period of 10 days from the time after the successful application of patches to the entire system. The patch activity is considered successful if the applied patch completely mitigated the vulnerability as intended and the system remained stable without any negative side effects as a result of the patch. At this point, the community can verify the checksum included in the proposal in step 2. The 10-day quiet period is the upper limit and in many cases, the details can be revealed earlier given the stability of the platform and components can be verified.

## What is a security patch?

A security patch is an update to software or firmware that mitigates existing known vulnerabilities present in them. For the Internet Computer, the security patches applied to the replica software and system canisters running in the Network Nervous System (NNS) are covered by this policy.

## Why is a security patch sensitive?

The release of a security patch before applying it to the intended system may provide adversaries with adequate information on the anatomy of the vulnerability it is trying to protect and how to exploit it for their gain.

## What is the need for the quiet period?

The Internet Computer is a complex piece of software with several distributed nodes. Despite comprehensive testing of the security patch, it is possible that something goes wrong. The quiet period provides ample time to ensure the stability of the system, and would allow a rollback if necessary before the content of the patch is revealed.

## When does the quiet period start?

Due to the complexity and distributed nature of the Internet Computer, patches and upgrades happen in a staggered manner, covering a few subnets at a time, and the entire process may take several days depending on the complexity of the patch and upgrade. The quiet period starts after 100 percent of the platform has been patched.

## 1. Objective
This proposal is meant to serve as a community temperature check for a proposal to officially rename the Internet Computer to the DFINITY Network.

## 2. Background
The authors of this proposal believe that such a renaming would provide benefits to the current Internet Computer community and clear the path for long term growth. Key points for consideration:

* The Internet Computer is a generic name. In our modern context, the words “internet” and “computer” are very commonplace and commodities in parlance. Feedback from the broader crypto community has generally been poor and has not received the name well.
* Seed investors invested in an idea named “DFINITY”. Similarly to the Ethereum project, it is a more simple path to leave no distinction between the parent organization and the network that it exists to represent. The current status quo is that the “DFINITY Foundation supports the Internet Computer Protocol” creating two separate hierarchies and causing general confusion and poor understanding. Since the Ethereum Foundation and the DFINITY Foundation are both Stiftungs based in Switzerland, the precedence already exists for this coupling between network and foundation.
* DFINITY is a unique, globally recognized brand and the network itself should benefit from this brand awareness. Indeed many web3 community members colloquially refer to the Internet Computer as “DFINITY” as it is easier, more comfortable and conveys the same meaning.

Network rebranding is not unprecedented in the Web3 ecosystem, in fact it is fairly commonplace. A major example was the rebranding of the Polygon network away from its original moniker the Matic network. 

In this instance, we can take learnings from the Polygon rebranding exercise. The network and associated web properties can be rebranded to the DFINITY Network, while the token ticker can remain the same: ICP. 

## 3. Cons
Such a rebranding effort takes resources and focus from the Foundation and the community.

## 4. What we are asking the community

This proposal does not seek to implement these changes immediately, but rather to spur the community to discuss whether or not this could be a worthwhile investment of time and resources.

If this proposal passes with the YES, we ask that the DFINITY Foundation draft a proposal for rebranding / renaming the Internet Computer network to the DFINITY Network along with estimated timelines for completion and put that proposal up for vote to the NNS community no later than June 1, 2022.

# Summary

The goal is to have a Bitcoin ledger that makes use of the Bitcoin integration on the IC to bring "Chain Key Bitcoin", referred to as ckBTC in this proposal, to the Internet Computer. Unlike standard "wrapped" Bitcoin solutions, this ledger will not depend on any bridge between the Bitcoin network and the Internet Computer.

If this functionality is built, it will be possible to exchange BTC for ckBTC and vice versa at a 1:1 rate as well as trade ckBTC at the speed of the Internet Computer.

To vote YES on this proposal means that you agree with the plan to build, launch, operate this functionality on the Internet Computer.

If this proposal fails, then this design will not be implemented and the community will go back to the drawing board.

# NNS Proposal: Chain Key Bitcoin Ledger on the Internet Computer

# Objective

The goal is to introduce a Bitcoin ledger on the Internet Computer based on the Bitcoin integration feature and Chain Key technology.

While the name is not set in stone, we call it the Chain Key Bitcoin (ckBTC) ledger in this design because it is one of the proposed names that received mostly positive feedback.

The ledger will make it possible to trade ckBTC at the speed of the Internet Computer at low cost. Moreover, it will offer mechanisms to convert BTC to ckBTC and vice versa, at a 1:1 rate. Thus, the Chain Key Bitcoin Ledger complements the Bitcoin integration functionality, simplifying the use of Bitcoin on the IC.

# 1. Proposal

## Design

The ckBTC functionality is introduced in the form of two new canisters:

* The ckBTC Ledger is an instance of a ledger, handling ckBTC transfers and managing account balances.
* The ckBTC Minter holds all Bitcoin of ckBTC holders and is in charge of issuing mint and burn calls to the ckBTC Ledger.

### ckBTC Ledger

The API of the ckBTC Ledger will be specified at a later stage. It will offer functions to query balances and transfer funds.

### ckBTC Minter

The ckBTC Minter will offer the following functions.

`get_btc_address(subaccount: vec nat8) -> (String);`

The function deterministically computes a Bitcoin address based on the ckBTC Minter’s main Bitcoin address and the caller’s principal ID, which is an implicit parameter of the function, and the provided subaccount.

Specifically, starting from the ckBTC Minter’s default key, BIP-32 key derivation is used to derive a key using the caller’s principal ID and the provided subaccount. The returned address is derived from this key.

Note that it is possible for a user to derive this Bitcoin address herself/himself.

`get_withdrawal_account() -> (AccountIdentifier);`

The function deterministically computes a ckBTC Ledger account ID based on the principal ID of ckBTC Minter and the principal ID of the caller. The ckBTC Minter burns the ckBTC transferred to this account when the owner calls retrieve_btc to retrieve the same amount in bitcoin.

`update_balance(subaccount: vec nat8) -> (UpdateBalanceResult);`

The function instructs the ckBTC Minter to update the ckBTC balance of the caller. Specifically, the ckBTC canister checks if there are new UTXOs associated with the Bitcoin address derived from the caller’s principal ID and the provided subaccount. If there are such UTXOs, the equivalent amount is minted in ckBTC and made available to the caller in the given subaccount.

This function must be invoked after sending bitcoin to the ckBTC Minter because the ckBTC Minter cannot know for which derived accounts it will receive funds.

`retrieve_btc(amount: Bitcoin, fee: opt Bitcoin, address: String) -> (RetrieveBtcResult);`

The function instructs the ckBTC Minter to send the given amount of Bitcoin to the provided Bitcoin address, burning the equivalent amount of ckBTC tokens. Note that at least the given amount must be transferred first, in ckBTC, to the caller’s withdrawal account. The withdrawal account is a ckBTC Ledger account under the control of the ckBTC Minter. The subaccount is derived deterministically from the user’s principal ID.

The optional fee parameter defines the fee to be used in the Bitcoin transaction that transfers the Bitcoin to the given Bitcoin address. If no fee is provided, the ckBTC Minter uses a standard fee, obtained through the Bitcoin integration fee API.

The ckBTC tokens are burned before the Bitcoin transaction is confirmed. If a transaction does not appear in a block, the user has the option to resubmit the transaction using the resubmit_retrieve_btc function below.

`get_minimum_fee() -> (Bitcoin) query;`

The function returns the minimum expected fee when providing a custom fee in the retrieve_btc function call.

The ckBTC Minter uses the Bitcoin integration fee API to derive this fee.

`resubmit_retrieve_btc(request_id: nat64, new_fee: Bitcoin) -> (ResubmitRetrieveBtcResult);`

The function instructs the ckBTC Minter to resubmit a Bitcoin transaction for a previous request, updating the fee. This function is intended to be used for transactions that are stuck because the fee was set too low.

The new fee must be higher than the last fee in the transaction associated with this request, increasing the fee according to [BIP-125](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0125.mediawiki).

# 2. Risks

If the ckBTC Minter or ckBTC Ledger is compromised, the funds provided in Bitcoin could be lost. The current plan is to deploy both canisters on a large system subnet, similar in size to the NNS, to mitigate this risk.

# 3. Alternative Designs

An alternative design would be to have a single canister acting as the ledger and custodian. Since we have a well-tested ledger available, having two separate canisters is considered to be a safer design. Moreover, reusing the existing ledger reduces the implementation effort.

# 4. Roll-out Plan

Once implementation and testing work has been completed, the plan is to deploy the two canisters to a system subnet, at which point the functionality becomes available.

If the ckBTC functionality is observed to behave as intended, the controller will be changed to the NNS, ensuring that any future changes can only happen with the approval of the community.

# 5. Timeline

If the NNS motion proposal is accepted, development will start right away. Proper testing will only be possible once the Bitcoin integration feature is operational. As a result, we plan to release the ckBTC functionality in Q3 2022.

##What’s Canister Builder DAO?

A community of builders who believe in the potential of Internet Computer, and collectively build a stronger Internet Computer ecosystem.

##Mission

CanisterBuilderDAO exists to advance the technology and adoption of Internet Computer.

##Values

- Transparency
- Responsibility
- Diversity and Inclusion

##Goals

- Foster & Build Developer Tools & Public Infrastructure
- Create & Promote Community Standards to Advance Interoperability in Internet Computer Ecosystem
- Onboard, Educate & Support New Developers for Internet Computer

##What is a Season?

A discrete period of time for DAO members to come together to align on projects and initiatives that help us deliver on our mission, values, and goals.

Objectives for each future Season must be defined upfront (process TBD) and, prior to ending a Season, a retrospective must be carried out to ensure we can learn and improve (process TBD).

##What is CBD going to do next?

Season 0：

- Neuron construction and related follow announcements
- Official website launched
- CBP-1: CBP Process
- CBP-2: Fungible Token Standard 8
- CBP-3：Develop admission criteria for absorbing high-quality infrastructure libraries, such as good unit tests and good documentation, and the development of the process of admission
- Reference more than 3 high-quality infrastructure libraries for the organization, and actively promote the community activity of related projects
- Regular meetups

##What can you do with CBD?

If you are a developer working on an IC project, you can find ready-to-use, high-quality libraries in CBD’s infrastructure library to help you better develop your project.

If your project is an infrastructure library, you can contact CBD and join the CBD infrastructure library. CBD will bring more users to your project. At the same time, the infrastructure library inside the CBD will undergo an internal review, which will allow Your project to quickly gain the trust of users, and CBD will also have regular sharing to help you promote your project.

If you do something convenient to standardize on IC, you can submit a proposal through CBD’s Github 9 for more community development participants in the development of the standard to provide you with more discussion and feedback.

   ## Summary

Update the ledger canister to commit [`45ed491cf5c52f0c9f68d6b0a860d44a6c827cf7`](https://github.com/dfinity/ic/commit/45ed491cf5c52f0c9f68d6b0a860d44a6c827cf7).

The [Wasm](https://download.dfinity.systems/ic/45ed491cf5c52f0c9f68d6b0a860d44a6c827cf7/canisters/ledger-canister_notify-method.wasm.gz) sha256 is `397431feceec09072c847938a943bf5daf480e19ee338fa935efea671b513074`.

The canister id is `ryjl3-tyaaa-aaaaa-aaaba-cai`, and the desired install mode is `upgrade`.

## Rationale

  * feat: Add a candid endpoint for fetching blocks.
  * feat: Add a candid endpoint to return the list of archive canisters.
  * feat: Add candid endpoints returning the current fee, the token symbol, the token name, and the number of decimals.
  * feat: Add `__get_candid_interface_tmp_hack` endpoint returning the candid interface file.
  * feat: Reduce the size of the Ledger canister to make it deployable to application subnets.
  * feat: Throttle transactions when the transaction cache reaches 50% of capacity.
  * chore: Update the embedded version of the ledger archive node canister.
  * fix: Return a structured error when transfer amount + fee overflows.
  * fix: Lower the maximum number of live accounts to a more realistic value determined by performance testing (50M -> 28M).
  * fix: Take permitted time drift into account when purging old transactions.

####本提案是关于如何创建动议提案的中文教程，它将用于提高治理参与度并且用作视频中发起提案的演示。

注：NNS的提案格式是markdown，我没有用过，今天刚学会一点，所以极有可能因为某些符号的原因使命令出错，可以在medium可以获得更好的阅读体验：<https://medium.com/@ysyms>
#以下教程程使用linux系统为例，且dfx没有windows版本，所以您可能需要安装wsl，相关教程非常多，请自行搜索

##所需环境：


1.安装dfx（dfx是canister的SDK）
2.安装keysmith（keysmith可以生成用于IC的公私钥对）
3.安装quill（quill是一个治理工具包，用于制作和向NNS发送消息）
以上程序都可以在dfinity的github找到：[DFINITY · GitHub](https://github.com/orgs/dfinity/repositories?type=all)
4：发起提案需要创建一个余额大于1icp溶解延迟长于6个月的神经元，请准备大于1个的icp。

##详细步骤：

//创建助记词
`$ keysmith generate`

//创建pem文件
`$ keysmith private-key`

//从私钥派生ICP的分类账账户，也就是常说的account id
`$ keysmith account -i 0`

得到如下地址：`6d139f4193f3c17d654afde57869ba8e53ee4e70141e3d0cd3f1bfe80c279ce3`

将这个公私钥对链接到dfx（请检查刚才生成的pem文件的名字，如果不是private.pem那么请将下列命令中的pem文件的名字替换成刚才生成的pem文件的名字）
`$dfx identity import proposals private.pem`

如果您在终端中看到"Create an identity：proposals "，则表示它有效

将大于1ICP发送到你通过keysmith account命令获取的地址中。（创建神经元需要0.0001icp手续费）
//通过quill制作一条用于创建神经元的消息。下列命令会以"最长8 个字符的$NAME 作为名字和 $AMOUNT 作为质押数量"来创建神经元。请将命令中的$NAME于$AMOUNT改成适当数据。(同样，请检查pem文件的名字)
`$quill --pem-file private.pem neuron-stake --name $NAME --amount $AMOUNT > message.json`

//发送上面的message.json
`$quill send message.json`

如果成功将返回神经元ID：
`neuron ID: 9_218_890_096_040_352_708| 9218890096040352708`

需要将神经元溶解延迟增加到至少6个月才可以发起提案，在 NNS 中，时间以秒为单位。一年（秒）：31557600 秒
//制作一个将神经元延迟时间增加到一年的消息（将下列命令中的神经元id修改刚才返回的神经元id，注意将下划线手动删除）

`$quill --pem-file private.pem neuron-manage 4702427116920021385 --additional-dissolve-delay-seconds 31557600 > message.json`

//发送刚刚制作的messages.json
`$quill send message.json`

通过dfx发送提案：（rrkah-fqaaa-aaaaa-aaaaq-cai 是 NNS 上治理容器的 ID ，因此下面的命令正在向 NNS 的治理容器的manage_neuron方法发送消息。）
您需要将$TITLE和$motion_text和$SUMMARY和$NEURON_ID改为适当内容。对应内容如图所示![](https://miro.medium.com/max/737/1*-C18-W6Muq9h8fxm1pXIkw.png)
`dfx --identity proposals canister --network ic --no-wallet call rrkah-fqaaa-aaaaa-aaaaq-cai manage_neuron [请将此处（包括中括号）替换为一个英文单引号](record {id = null; command=opt variant {MakeProposal=record {url=""; title="$TITLE";action=opt variant {Motion=record {motion_text="$MOTION_TEXT"}}; summary="$SUMMARY"}}; neuron_id_or_subaccount=opt variant {NeuronId=record {id=$NEURON_ID:nat64}}})[请将此处（包括中括号）替换为一个英文单引号]`
`

如果成功，dfx 将返回如下内容：

`(
  record {
    2_171_433_291 = opt variant {
      3_217_030_240 = record {
        2_744_746_248 = opt record { 23_515 = 42_626 : nat64 };
      }
    };
  },
)
`

其中 42_626 是提案的ID

# Frequently initiated motion proposal period lasting seven days

## 0.self introduction

Hello everyone, I am ysyms and also a youtuber following icp. This is my channel: [ysyms.youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFjVoQ3UNlsVHPCF2BH4iZA)

## 1. Objective

1.Increase participation in motion proposals
2.Increase the daily return of neurons participating in motion proposals

## 2. Background and Motivation for the proposal

1.Even though dfinity has started voting, the voting participation for motion-type proposals is still less than 50%.
2. In a typical week, the total weight of exchange rate proposals will be roughly 10 (144 * 7 * 0.01) and maintenance proposals will add up to a weight in the range of 5 to 30（Data source: Proposal 34485），And each governance proposal has a weight of 20。The total weight of proposals other than motion proposals is around 30 each week
3. The cost of initiating a governance proposal is 1 icp .(or 0 if executed)
4. Daily neuron rewards are correlated with weights

In summary: We only need to initiate two motion proposals every day, then the weekly motion proposals can account for about 90% of the total weight, and neurons that actively vote will receive 90% of all additional ICPs issued by NNS as revenue. According to the first point, less than 50% of neurons participate in voting on governance proposals, so I only need to spend 2 ICP per day to increase the daily return from 0.059% to about 0.106%, This will increase the revenue of neurons participating in the motion proposal by 1.8 times(that is you), and all this requires only 2 ICPs and typing some commands, which is a great thing, Do not you think?

This will be profitable for the whales of the icp, I do not understand why no one is doing it, maybe it is because my understanding of NNS is a bit wrong. So I will verify it in the next seven days.

## 3. I will do 

Regardless of whether the proposal is passed or not, for the next 7 days, I will publish two motion proposals per day on NNS to verify the correctness of the conclusion.

I pay attention to IC and its ecological development every day, and I will try to send some meaningful proposals. sorry to bother you

## 4. common problem

1.Is this unfair to neurons that do not vote?
I think it is fair. NNS is a governance system. If a neuron is only for passive income, does not care about the change of weight, does not care about the governance of IC, and even is unwilling to follow a neuron to vote, then it should not get income, let alone get more More power to control ICP.So I think it is more beneficial for ICP to launch two motion proposals every day. This can greatly increase the voting willingness of neurons, improve the enthusiasm of the community, and allow ICP to be issued to those who actively participate in governance.

Please check the 52214 proposal, dfinity and ica and icpmn and cycledao.xyz all voted "no", but even then the participation rate of the whole proposal is still less than 50%. We may never use an "absolute majority".

2.Can this be avoided by raising the threshold for initiating proposals?
Maybe that can stop me, but not the giant whale. This will only make the NNS dictatorial.

3.Can this be avoided by lowering the weight of motion proposals?
Maybe, for reference: Before the weight of the governance proposal was increased, the voting participation of the governance proposal was only about 10%.

## 5.Epilogue

Please forgive me for using such a strange tone and format to initiate a proposal, I am a high school student not a developer, not familiar with markdown, bad english, use google translate, sorry

14 ICPs are enough for my living expenses for one month. Within seven days, if you agree with my point of view or benefit from it, please actively participate in governance

If you think the proposal process is too cumbersome, you can transfer the ICP to this address: `a367ed0ae66218194aafc9fb484dd78cc78fa28b57f4cc69b106e6aafd7403ea`, as long as the account has enough balance to initiate a proposal, then I will insist on sending two motion proposals every day.You can also tell me the motion proposal you want to send through the following methods, and I will submit it to NNS for you (if you can accept me using google translate to communicate with you) telegram: @ysyms; twitter: @ai_ccp251th; openchat: ysyms 

During this period, my income will not increase by 14 ICP because I only have neurons with a total of 100+ ICP.

# 持续7天的频繁动议提案期

## 0.个人介绍

哈喽大家好我是ysyms，一个专注于ICP的youtuber。这是我的频道：[ysyms.youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFjVoQ3UNlsVHPCF2BH4iZA)
其他联系方式：
twitter：@ai_ccp251th;

## 1. 目标

1.提高动议提案的参与度
2.提高参与动议提案神经元的投票奖励

## 2. 提案的背景和动机

1.在动议提案的权重提高之后，即使dfinity已经开始投票，动议提案的投票参与度依然不足50%，
2.在提案权重更改后，每周后的汇率提案总权重为10，每周维护提案的总权重将在5到30之间（数据来源于34485提案），而每个动议提案的权重为20。每周除动议类型以外的提案总权重为30左右
3.发起一个动议提案的成本为1个icp（如果得到执行那么将是0成本）
4.每日神经元奖励根据权重来分配

综上所述：我们只需要每天发起两个动议提案那么每周的动议提案就可以占到90%左右的总权重，积极投票的神经元将获得NNS所有增发ICP的百分之90%作为收益。根据第一点，参与动议提案投票的神经元只有不到50%，所以我每天只需要花费2个icp的成本就可以将0.059%的日收益增加到0.106%左右，这会使积极投票的神经元（也就是你们）的收益提升1.8倍，而这一切只需要2个icp和输入一些命令，这是一件很伟大的事，你觉得呢？

这对icp的鲸鱼来说这将有利可图，我不明白为什么没有人这样做，也许是因为我对NNS的理解有些错误。所以我将在接下来的七天内验证它。

## 3. 我将要做 

不管该提案是否通过，在接下来的7天中我都将会在NNS每天发表两个动议提案用于验证结论的正确性
我每天都在关注IC及其生态发展，我会尽量发一些有意义的提案。打扰了抱歉

## 4. 常见问题

这对不投票的神经元很不公平吗？
我认为这很公平。NNS是一个治理系统，如果一个神经元只为了被动收益，不关心权重的更改，不关心IC的治理，甚至不愿意去随手跟随一个神经元投票，那么它不应该获得收益，更不应该获得更多控制ICP的权力。所以我认为目前每天发起两个动议提案对ICP来说是利大于弊的，这可以很大程度上增加神经元的投票意愿，提高社区积极性，并让ICP增发给积极参治理的人。
请检查52214提案，dfinity和ica和icpmn和cycledao.xyz都投了“no“，但即便如次整个提案的参与度仍然不足50%。我们也许永远用不到”绝对多数“。

这可以通过提高发起提案的门槛来避免吗？
也许可以避免我，但无法避免巨鲸，也会让治理变得更加独裁

这可以通过降低动议提案的权重来避免吗？
也许吧，参考：在动议提案的权重得到提升前，动议提案的投票参与度只有百分之十左右。

## 5.结语

请原谅我使用那么奇怪的格式发起提案，我是一个高中生并非开发者，今天刚学会了一点markdown，抱歉

14个icp足够我一个月生活费了，七天内，如果您因此获利或认同我的观点，请积极的提出和表决动议提案。

如果您认为提案流程过于繁琐，可以向该地址转入ICP： `a367ed0ae66218194aafc9fb484dd78cc78fa28b57f4cc69b106e6aafd7403ea`，只要该账户的余额足够发起提案，那么以后我将每天坚持发两个动议提案。您也可以在转入ICP后将您想发的动议提案通过以下方式告诉我，我会帮你提交到NNS telegram：[@ysyms](https://t.me/ysyms)；twitter：[@ai_ccp251th](https://twitter.com/AI_ccp251th); openchat id:ysyms

在此期间，我的收入不会增加 14 ICP，因为我只有总额100多个ICP的神经元。

# Release Notes:
* Fix of a sensitive security vulnerability

**Note:** In accordance with the Security Patch Policy and Procedure that was adopted in proposal [48792](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/48792), the source code that was used to build this release will be exposed only after the fix is rolled out to all subnets.

The community will be able to retroactively verify the binaries that were rolled out. The procedure for rebuilding the binaries and obtaining the sha256 sums of the rolled out binaries is:

```
git clone https://github.com/dfinity/ic.git
cd ic
git checkout 8ddc21605527de3802557f195e870cc6a3cb6393
./gitlab-ci/tools/docker-build-ic
```

This will generate the build image with the hash:
```

```
Which is the sha256sum of the update image used in this proposal.

# Please lower the technical threshold for initiating motion proposals.

[TOCM]

## about me:[ysyms.icp](https://ysyms.icp.page/)

## Objective
1.Request DFINITY to lower the technical threshold for initiating proposals
2.Increase community participation in motion proposals

## Background and Motivation for the proposal
As a non-developer, I learned WSL, I learned linux, I learned dfx, I learned keysmith, I learned quill, I learned markdown, I encountered various symbol errors and version conflicts, and the ICP wiki does not explain what is markdown, it should How to use, for which I lost two ICP (please check [52537](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/52537) proposal and [52214](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/ 52214) proposal). And all this is just to send a piece of text with a format to NNS, can not it be implemented in the front end of NNS?

Dominic, can you see that? You said NNS is the most advanced DAO in the world, you said ICP will reshape Internet services. But the DAO that controls the ICP is keeping all non-developers out. Does the most advanced DAO in the world allow ordinary investors and users to initiate motion proposals? This shit-initiating proposal process is sabotaging it all and DFINITY needs to act on it!

## Voting explanation

1: If you think DFINITY should lower the technical threshold for initiating proposals, please vote "yes"
2: if you think the process of initiating a proposal should remain as it is,Please vote "no"
3: If you think the proposal is irrelevant, please vote "no"

# 请降低发起治理提案的技术门槛

## 关于我:[ysyms.icp](https://ysyms.icp.page/)

## 目标

1.请求DFINITY降低发起提案的技术门槛

2.提升社区对动议提案的参与度

## 背景和提案动机

作为一个非开发者，我学了WSL学习了linux我学习了dfx我学习了keysmith我学习了quill我学习了markdown，遇到了各种符号错误与版本冲突，ICP wiki也没有解释什么markdown，它应该如何使用，为此我损失了两个ICP(请检查[52537](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/52537)提案和[52214](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/52214)提案)。而这一切不过是为了向NNS发送一段带有格式的文字，难道在NNS前端不能实现吗？

大裁缝你能看到吗？您说过NNS是世界上最先进的DAO，您说过ICP将重构互联网服务。可是控制着ICP的DAO正在把所有非开发者挡在门外，难道世界上最先进的DAO不允许普通投资人和用户发起动议提案吗？这个狗屎提案发起程序正在破坏这一切，DFINITY需要为此做出行动！

## 投票说明
1:如果您认为DFINITY应该降低发起提案的技术门槛请投"yes"
2:如果您认为发起提案的流程应该保持现状请投"no"
3:如果您认为该提案如您无关请投"no"

# What is "Frequently initiated motion proposal period lasting seven days"

[TOCM]

[TOC]


## 0.self introduction

Hello everyone, I am ysyms and also a youtuber following icp. This is my ICNS home page:[ysyms.icp.page](ysyms.icp.page)

## 1. Objective

1.Increase participation in motion proposals
2.Increase the daily return of neurons participating in motion proposals

## 2. Background and Motivation for the proposal

1.Even though dfinity has started voting, the voting participation for motion-type proposals is still less than 50%.
2. In a typical week, the total weight of exchange rate proposals will be roughly 10 (144 * 7 * 0.01) and maintenance proposals will add up to a weight in the range of 5 to 30（Data source: Proposal 34485），And each governance proposal has a weight of 20。The total weight of proposals other than motion proposals is around 30 each week
3. The cost of initiating a governance proposal is 1 icp .(or 0 if executed)
4. Daily neuron rewards are correlated with weights

In summary: We only need to initiate two motion proposals every day, then the weekly motion proposals can account for about 90% of the total weight, and neurons that actively vote will receive 90% of all additional ICPs issued by NNS as revenue. According to the first point, less than 50% of neurons participate in voting on governance proposals, so I only need to spend 2 ICP per day to increase the daily return from 0.059% to about 0.106%, This will increase the revenue of neurons participating in the motion proposal by 1.8 times(that is you), and all this requires only 2 ICPs and typing some commands, which is a great thing, Do not you think?

This will be profitable for the whales of the icp, I do not understand why no one is doing it, maybe it is because my understanding of NNS is a bit wrong. So I will verify it in the next seven days.

## 3. I will do 

Regardless of whether the proposal is passed or not, for the next 7 days, I will publish two motion proposals per day on NNS to verify the correctness of the conclusion.

I pay attention to IC and its ecological development every day, and I will try to send some meaningful proposals. sorry to bother you

## 4. common problem

1.Is this unfair to neurons that do not vote?
I think it is fair. NNS is a governance system. If a neuron is only for passive income, does not care about the change of weight, does not care about the governance of IC, and even is unwilling to follow a neuron to vote, then it should not get income, let alone get more More power to control ICP.So I think it is more beneficial for ICP to launch two motion proposals every day. This can greatly increase the voting willingness of neurons, improve the enthusiasm of the community, and allow ICP to be issued to those who actively participate in governance.

Please check the 52214 proposal, dfinity and ica and icpmn and cycledao.xyz all voted "no", but even then the participation rate of the whole proposal is still less than 50%. We may never use an "absolute majority".

2.Can this be avoided by raising the threshold for initiating proposals?
Maybe that can stop me, but not the giant whale. This will only make the NNS dictatorial.

3.Can this be avoided by lowering the weight of motion proposals?
Maybe, for reference: Before the weight of the governance proposal was increased, the voting participation of the governance proposal was only about 10%.

## 5.Epilogue

Please forgive me for using such a strange tone and format to initiate a proposal, I am a high school student not a developer, not familiar with markdown, bad english, use google translate, sorry

14 ICPs are enough for my living expenses for one month. Within seven days, if you agree with my point of view or benefit from it, please actively participate in governance

If you think the proposal process is too cumbersome, you can transfer the ICP to this address: `a367ed0ae66218194aafc9fb484dd78cc78fa28b57f4cc69b106e6aafd7403ea`, as long as the account has enough balance to initiate a proposal, then I will insist on sending two motion proposals every day.You can also tell me the motion proposal you want to send through the following methods, and I will submit it to NNS for you (if you can accept me using google translate to communicate with you):[ysyms.icp.page](ysyms.icp.page)

During this period, my income will not increase by 14 ICP because I only have neurons with a total of 100+ ICP.

# 持续7天的频繁动议提案期

## 0.个人介绍

哈喽大家好我是ysyms，一个专注于ICP的youtuber。这是我的ICNS主页：[ysyms.icp.page](ysyms.icp.page)

## 1. 目标

1.提高动议提案的参与度
2.提高参与动议提案神经元的投票奖励

## 2. 提案的背景和动机

1.在动议提案的权重提高之后，即使dfinity已经开始投票，动议提案的投票参与度依然不足50%，
2.在提案权重更改后，每周后的汇率提案总权重为10，每周维护提案的总权重将在5到30之间（数据来源于34485提案），而每个动议提案的权重为20。每周除动议类型以外的提案总权重为30左右
3.发起一个动议提案的成本为1个icp（如果得到执行那么将是0成本）
4.每日神经元奖励根据权重来分配

综上所述：我们只需要每天发起两个动议提案那么每周的动议提案就可以占到90%左右的总权重，积极投票的神经元将获得NNS所有增发ICP的百分之90%作为收益。根据第一点，参与动议提案投票的神经元只有不到50%，所以我每天只需要花费2个icp的成本就可以将0.059%的日收益增加到0.106%左右，这会使积极投票的神经元（也就是你们）的收益提升1.8倍，而这一切只需要2个icp和输入一些命令，这是一件很伟大的事，你觉得呢？

这对icp的鲸鱼来说这将有利可图，我不明白为什么没有人这样做，也许是因为我对NNS的理解有些错误。所以我将在接下来的七天内验证它。

## 3. 我将要做 

不管该提案是否通过，在接下来的7天中我都将会在NNS每天发表两个动议提案用于验证结论的正确性
我每天都在关注IC及其生态发展，我会尽量发一些有意义的提案。打扰了抱歉

## 4. 常见问题

这对不投票的神经元很不公平吗？
我认为这很公平。NNS是一个治理系统，如果一个神经元只为了被动收益，不关心权重的更改，不关心IC的治理，甚至不愿意去随手跟随一个神经元投票，那么它不应该获得收益，更不应该获得更多控制ICP的权力。所以我认为目前每天发起两个动议提案对ICP来说是利大于弊的，这可以很大程度上增加神经元的投票意愿，提高社区积极性，并让ICP增发给积极参治理的人。
请检查52214提案，dfinity和ica和icpmn和cycledao.xyz都投了"no"，但即便如次整个提案的参与度仍然不足50%。我们也许永远用不到"绝对多数"。

这可以通过提高发起提案的门槛来避免吗？
也许可以避免我，但无法避免巨鲸，也会让治理变得更加独裁

这可以通过降低动议提案的权重来避免吗？
也许吧，参考：在动议提案的权重得到提升前，动议提案的投票参与度只有百分之十左右。

## 5.结语

请原谅我使用那么奇怪的格式发起提案，我是一个高中生并非开发者，今天刚学会了一点markdown，抱歉

14个icp足够我一个月生活费了，七天内，如果您因此获利或认同我的观点，请积极的提出和表决动议提案。

如果您认为提案流程过于繁琐，可以向该地址转入ICP： `a367ed0ae66218194aafc9fb484dd78cc78fa28b57f4cc69b106e6aafd7403ea`，只要该账户的余额足够发起提案，那么以后我将每天坚持发两个动议提案。您也可以在转入ICP后将您想发的动议提案通过以下方式告诉我，我会帮你提交到NNS: [ysyms.icp.page](ysyms.icp.page)

在此期间，我的收入不会增加 14 ICP，因为我只有总额100多个ICP的神经元。

# 1.2 Hope plug wallet supports internet identity

## about me:[ysyms.icp.page](https://ysyms.icp.page/)

## Objective

1.Hope plug wallet can support internet identity login.
2.Hope that Internet identity can be widely used.

## Background and Motivation for the proposal

plug wallet has recently released a [beta version for IOS](https://beta.plugwallet.ooo), and it is great, but when I want to sync plug"s browser plug-in wallet account to an ios device, I am going to face a tedious process and a huge risk. I am tired of using mnemonics to sync between various devices. I really like Internet idenity. Internet identity are the infrastructure of ICP. I hope the plug team can make it compatible as soon as possible.

## Voting explanation

1: If you think plug wallet needs to be compatible with Internet identity, please vote: "yes"
2: If you think plug wallet does not need to be compatible with Internet identity please: "no"
3: If you think the proposal has nothing to do with your pledged ICP, please vote: "no"

Maybe this proposal will not have as far-reaching impact on ICP as the "ICP Integrate BTC" proposal, but as part of the ICP ecosystem, we hope that plug wallet will become better. While the proposal cannot determine the plug teams roadmap, I think the plug team can see what the ICP community really thinks through the voting on the proposal.

# 1.2 希望plug钱包支持互联网身份登录

## 关于我:[ysyms.icp.page](https://ysyms.icp.page/)

##目标

1.希望plug钱包能支持互联网身份登录
2.希望互联网身份能被广泛应用

## 背景和提案动机

plug钱包最近发布了[IOS测试版本](https://beta.plugwallet.ooo)，它非常棒，但是当我想把plug的浏览器插件钱包账户同步到ios设备时，我将会面临繁琐的过程以及巨大的风险。我受够了使用助记词在各种在各种设备间同步，我非常喜欢互联网身份，互联网身份作为ICP的基础设施，希望plug团队可以尽早兼容它。


## 投票说明

1:如果您认为plug钱包需要兼容互联网身份请投:"yes"
2:如果您认为plug钱包不需要兼容互联网身份请:"no"
3:如果您认为该提案与您质押的ICP无关请投:"no"

该提案可能不会像 "ICP集成BTC"提案 那样对ICP产生深远的影响，但plug钱包做为ICP生态的一部分，我们希望它变得更好。虽然该提案无法决定plug团队的路线图，但我认为可以通过提案的投票情况来让plug团队来看到ICP社区的真实想法

# What is "Frequently initiated motion proposal period lasting seven days"


## 0.self introduction

Hello everyone, I am ysyms and also a youtuber following icp. This is my ICNS home page:[ysyms.icp.page](ysyms.icp.page)

## 1. Objective

1.Increase participation in motion proposals
2.Increase the daily return of neurons participating in motion proposals

## 2. Background and Motivation for the proposal

1.Even though dfinity has started voting, the voting participation for motion-type proposals is still less than 50%.
2.In a typical week, the total weight of exchange rate proposals will be roughly 10 (144 * 7 * 0.01) and maintenance proposals will add up to a weight in the range of 5 to 30（Data source: Proposal 34485），And each governance proposal has a weight of 20。The total weight of proposals other than motion proposals is around 30 each week
3.The cost of initiating a governance proposal is 1 icp .(or 0 if executed)
4.Daily neuron rewards are correlated with weights

In summary: We only need to initiate two motion proposals every day, then the weekly motion proposals can account for about 90% of the total weight, and neurons that actively vote will receive 90% of all additional ICPs issued by NNS as revenue. According to the first point, less than 50% of neurons participate in voting on governance proposals, so I only need to spend 2 ICP per day to increase the daily return from 0.059% to about 0.106%, This will increase the revenue of neurons participating in the motion proposal by 1.8 times(that is you), and all this requires only 2 ICPs and typing some commands, which is a great thing, Do not you think?

This will be profitable for the whales of the icp, I do not understand why no one is doing it, maybe it is because my understanding of NNS is a bit wrong. So I will verify it in the next seven days.

## 3. I will do 

Regardless of whether the proposal is passed or not, for the next 7 days, I will publish two motion proposals per day on NNS to verify the correctness of the conclusion.

I pay attention to IC and its ecological development every day, and I will try to send some meaningful proposals. sorry to bother you

## 4. common problem

1.Is this unfair to neurons that do not vote?
I think it is fair. NNS is a governance system. If a neuron is only for passive income, does not care about the change of weight, does not care about the governance of IC, and even is unwilling to follow a neuron to vote, then it should not get income, let alone get more More power to control ICP.So I think it is more beneficial for ICP to launch two motion proposals every day. This can greatly increase the voting willingness of neurons, improve the enthusiasm of the community, and allow ICP to be issued to those who actively participate in governance.

Please check the 52214 proposal, dfinity and ica and icpmn and cycledao.xyz all voted "no", but even then the participation rate of the whole proposal is still less than 50%. We may never use an "absolute majority".

2.Can this be avoided by raising the threshold for initiating proposals?
Maybe that can stop me, but not the giant whale. This will only make the NNS dictatorial.

3.Can this be avoided by lowering the weight of motion proposals?
Maybe, for reference: Before the weight of the governance proposal was increased, the voting participation of the governance proposal was only about 10%.

## 5.Epilogue

Please forgive me for using such a strange tone and format to initiate a proposal, I am a high school student not a developer, not familiar with markdown, bad english, use google translate, sorry

14 ICPs are enough for my living expenses for one month. Within seven days, if you agree with my point of view or benefit from it, please actively participate in governance

If you think the proposal process is too cumbersome, you can transfer the ICP to this address: `a367ed0ae66218194aafc9fb484dd78cc78fa28b57f4cc69b106e6aafd7403ea`, as long as the account has enough balance to initiate a proposal, then I will insist on sending two motion proposals every day.You can also tell me the motion proposal you want to send through the following methods, and I will submit it to NNS for you (if you can accept me using google translate to communicate with you):[ysyms.icp.page](ysyms.icp.page)

During this period, my income will not increase by 14 ICP because I only have neurons with a total of 100+ ICP.

# 持续7天的频繁动议提案期

## 0.个人介绍

哈喽大家好我是ysyms，一个专注于ICP的youtuber。这是我的ICNS主页：[ysyms.icp.page](ysyms.icp.page)

## 1. 目标

1.提高动议提案的参与度
2.提高参与动议提案神经元的投票奖励

## 2. 提案的背景和动机

1.在动议提案的权重提高之后，即使dfinity已经开始投票，动议提案的投票参与度依然不足50%，
2.在提案权重更改后，每周后的汇率提案总权重为10，每周维护提案的总权重将在5到30之间（数据来源于34485提案），而每个动议提案的权重为20。每周除动议类型以外的提案总权重为30左右
3.发起一个动议提案的成本为1个icp（如果得到执行那么将是0成本）
4.每日神经元奖励根据权重来分配

综上所述：我们只需要每天发起两个动议提案那么每周的动议提案就可以占到90%左右的总权重，积极投票的神经元将获得NNS所有增发ICP的百分之90%作为收益。根据第一点，参与动议提案投票的神经元只有不到50%，所以我每天只需要花费2个icp的成本就可以将0.059%的日收益增加到0.106%左右，这会使积极投票的神经元（也就是你们）的收益提升1.8倍，而这一切只需要2个icp和输入一些命令，这是一件很伟大的事，你觉得呢？

这对icp的鲸鱼来说这将有利可图，我不明白为什么没有人这样做，也许是因为我对NNS的理解有些错误。所以我将在接下来的七天内验证它。

## 3. 我将要做 

不管该提案是否通过，在接下来的7天中我都将会在NNS每天发表两个动议提案用于验证结论的正确性
我每天都在关注IC及其生态发展，我会尽量发一些有意义的提案。打扰了抱歉

## 4. 常见问题

这对不投票的神经元很不公平吗？
我认为这很公平。NNS是一个治理系统，如果一个神经元只为了被动收益，不关心权重的更改，不关心IC的治理，甚至不愿意去随手跟随一个神经元投票，那么它不应该获得收益，更不应该获得更多控制ICP的权力。所以我认为目前每天发起两个动议提案对ICP来说是利大于弊的，这可以很大程度上增加神经元的投票意愿，提高社区积极性，并让ICP增发给积极参治理的人。
请检查52214提案，dfinity和ica和icpmn和cycledao.xyz都投了"no"，但即便如次整个提案的参与度仍然不足50%。我们也许永远用不到"绝对多数"。

这可以通过提高发起提案的门槛来避免吗？
也许可以避免我，但无法避免巨鲸，也会让治理变得更加独裁

这可以通过降低动议提案的权重来避免吗？
也许吧，参考：在动议提案的权重得到提升前，动议提案的投票参与度只有百分之十左右。

## 5.结语

请原谅我使用那么奇怪的格式发起提案，我是一个高中生并非开发者，今天刚学会了一点markdown，抱歉

14个icp足够我一个月生活费了，七天内，如果您因此获利或认同我的观点，请积极的提出和表决动议提案。

如果您认为提案流程过于繁琐，可以向该地址转入ICP： `a367ed0ae66218194aafc9fb484dd78cc78fa28b57f4cc69b106e6aafd7403ea`，只要该账户的余额足够发起提案，那么以后我将每天坚持发两个动议提案。您也可以在转入ICP后将您想发的动议提案通过以下方式告诉我，我会帮你提交到NNS: [ysyms.icp.page](ysyms.icp.page)

在此期间，我的收入不会增加 14 ICP，因为我只有总额100多个ICP的神经元。

# 2.1 EXT([Extendable Token Standard](https://toniqlabs.com/)) is one of the recognized NFT standards in the ICP blockchain

## about me:[ysyms.icp.page](https://ysyms.icp.page/)

## Objective

1.Make the ICP community reach a consensus on "EXT is one of the recognized NFT standards in the ICP blockchain".

## Background and Motivation for the proposal

For a long time, the ICP ecology has faced the problem of lack of various standards, and NNS can reach a consensus on a certain problem very well.

![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FPYTCGvVkAA4tu1?format=jpg&name=900x900)
In the ICP blockchain, the total [market](https://entrepot.app/marketplace) value of NFTs issued based on EXT is close to 2 million ICPs, and the number of unique holding addresses has exceeded 60,000 (data source: [nftgeek.app](https://t5t44-naaaa-aaaah-qcutq-cai.raw.ic0.app/)), I think this is enough to make EXT a recognized NFT one of the standards.

If you own an NFT issued using EXT, please spread this proposal.

## Voting explanation

1: If you think EXT can be used as one of the recognized NFT standards in the ICP blockchain, please vote "yes"
2: If you think EXT cannot be used as one of the recognized NFT standards in the ICP blockchain, please vote "no"
3: If you think this proposal has nothing to do with your locked ICP, please vote "no"

If this proposal is implemented, ICP" infrastructure should support EXT-standard NFTs as soon as possible, especially NNS frontends!

# 2.1 [EXT](https://github.com/Toniq-Labs/extendable-token)(Extendable Token Standard)是ICP区块链中的公认的NFT标准之一

## 关于我:[ysyms.icp.page](https://ysyms.icp.page/)

## 目标

1.使社区对"EXT标准（Extendable Token Standard）是ICP区块链中公认的NFT标准之一"达成共识。

## 背景和提案动机

一直以来，ICP生态面临缺乏各种标准的问题，NNS可以很好的对某一问题达成共识。
![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FPYTCGvVkAA4tu1?format=jpg&name=900x900)
在ICP区块链，基于EXT标准所发行的NFTs总市值已接近200万个ICP,独立持有地址已经超过6万个(数据来源:[nftgeek.app](https://t5t44-naaaa-aaaah-qcutq-cai.raw.ic0.app/))，我认为这已经足以让EXT标准成为公认的NFT标准之一。如果您拥有使用EXT标准所发行的NFTs请为本提案拉票。

## 投票说明

1:如果您认为EXT标准可以作为ICP公认的NFT标准之一请投"yes"
2:如果您认为EXT标准不可以作为ICP公认的NFT标准之一请投"no"
3:如果您认为本提案与您质押的ICP无关请投"no"

如果该提案得到执行，ICP的基础设施应尽快支持EXT标准的NFT，特别是NNS前端！

# 2.2 The NFT stored in the stoic wallet should not need to manually add the canister id before it can be displayed

## about me:[ysyms.icp.page](https://ysyms.icp.page/)

## Objective

1.The NFT stored in the stoic wallet should not need to manually add the canister id before it can be displayed

## Background

I do not know when it started, the NFTs you purchased in Entrepot with stoic wallet will not be displayed automatically in the wallet, you must manually add the canister id of that nft before it can be displayed, but it is normal in Entrepot. As far as I know, both the entrepot and the stoic are developed by ToniqLabs, In this case, the stoic wallet should have automatically displayed all NFTs listed on Entrepot, and should not need such a stupid operation.

## why this matters

1.For the same reason, stoic wallet is a part of the ICP ecosystem, we hope it will become better
2.Entrepot is the largest NFT market on the ICP blockchain. I don’t want new users to come to the ICP blockchain to see such a chaotic ecology, and even they belong to the same team, which is unbelievable.

## Voting explanation

1.if you think The NFT stored in the stoic wallet should not need to manually add the canister id before it can be displayed. Please vote "yes"
2.if you think The NFT stored in the stoic wallet should need to manually add the canister id before it can be displayed. Please vote "no"

3.if you think this proposal has nothing to do with ICP.Please vote "no"

Although this proposal cannot decide what toniqlabs thinks even if it is implemented, it allows toniqlabs to see what the ICP community really thinks.

# 2.2 存放在stoic钱包的NFT不应该需要手动添加canister id后才能显示

## 关于我:[ysyms.icp.page](https://ysyms.icp.page/)

## 目标

1.存放在stoic钱包的NFT不应该需要手动添加canister id后才可以显示

##背景

不知从何时开始，你使用stoic钱包在Entrepot购买的NFTs不会在钱包内自动显示，您必须手动添加那个nft的canister id后才可以显示，而在Entrepot中却很正常。据我所知，entrepot和stoic都由ToniqLabs开发，既然如此，stoic钱包本应去自动显示在Entrepot上架的所有NFTs，不应该需要如此愚蠢的操作。

toniqlabs，您还好吗？

## 为什么这很重要

1.同样的理由，stoic钱包作为ICP生态的一部分，我们希望它变的更好
2.Entrepot是ICP链上最大的NFT市场，我不希望新用户来到ICP区块链看到却是一个如此混乱的生态，甚至他们还属于同一个团队，这简直难以置信。

## 投票说明

1.如果你认为存放在stoic钱包的NFT不应该需要手动添加canister id后才能显示请投 "yes"
2.如果你认为存放在stoic钱包的NFT应该需要手动添加canister id后才能显示请投 "no"
3.如果你认为本提案与ICP无关请投"no"

虽然即使本提案得以执行也无法决定toniqlabs的想法，但它可以让toniqlabs看到ICP社区的真实想法。

1.Even though dfinity has started voting, the voting participation for motion-type proposals is still less than 50%.
2.In a typical week, the total weight of exchange rate proposals will be roughly 10 (144 * 7 * 0.01) and maintenance proposals will add up to a weight in the range of 5 to 30（Data source: Proposal 34485），And each governance proposal has a weight of 20。The total weight of proposals other than motion proposals is around 30 each week
3.The cost of initiating a governance proposal is 1 icp .(or 0 if executed)
4.Daily neuron rewards are correlated with weights

In summary: We only need to initiate two motion proposals every day, then the weekly motion proposals can account for about 90% of the total weight, and neurons that actively vote will receive 90% of all additional ICPs issued by NNS as revenue. According to the first point, less than 50% of neurons participate in voting on governance proposals, so I only need to spend 2 ICP per day to increase the daily return from 0.059% to about 0.106%, This will increase the revenue of neurons participating in the motion proposal by 1.8 times(that is you), and all this requires only 2 ICPs and typing some commands, which is a great thing, Do not you think?

This will be profitable for the whales of the icp, I do not understand why no one is doing it, maybe it is because my understanding of NNS is a bit wrong. So I will verify it in the next seven days.

## 3. I will do 

Regardless of whether the proposal is passed or not, for the next 7 days, I will publish two motion proposals per day on NNS to verify the correctness of the conclusion.

I pay attention to IC and its ecological development every day, and I will try to send some meaningful proposals. sorry to bother you

## 4. common problem

1.Is this unfair to neurons that do not vote?
I think it is fair. NNS is a governance system. If a neuron is only for passive income, does not care about the change of weight, does not care about the governance of IC, and even is unwilling to follow a neuron to vote, then it should not get income, let alone get more More power to control ICP.So I think it is more beneficial for ICP to launch two motion proposals every day. This can greatly increase the voting willingness of neurons, improve the enthusiasm of the community, and allow ICP to be issued to those who actively participate in governance.

Please check the 52214 proposal, dfinity and ica and icpmn and cycledao.xyz all voted "no", but even then the participation rate of the whole proposal is still less than 50%. We may never use an "absolute majority".

2.Can this be avoided by raising the threshold for initiating proposals?
Maybe that can stop me, but not the giant whale. This will only make the NNS dictatorial.

3.Can this be avoided by lowering the weight of motion proposals?
Maybe, for reference: Before the weight of the governance proposal was increased, the voting participation of the governance proposal was only about 10%.

## 5.Epilogue

Please forgive me for using such a strange tone and format to initiate a proposal, I am a high school student not a developer, not familiar with markdown, bad english, use google translate, sorry

14 ICPs are enough for my living expenses for one month. Within seven days, if you agree with my point of view or benefit from it, please actively participate in governance

If you think the proposal process is too cumbersome, you can transfer the ICP to this address: `a367ed0ae66218194aafc9fb484dd78cc78fa28b57f4cc69b106e6aafd7403ea`, as long as the account has enough balance to initiate a proposal, then I will insist on sending two motion proposals every day.You can also tell me the motion proposal you want to send through the following methods, and I will submit it to NNS for you (if you can accept me using google translate to communicate with you):[ysyms.icp.page](ysyms.icp.page)

During this period, my income will not increase by 14 ICP because I only have neurons with a total of 100+ ICP.

# 持续7天的频繁动议提案期

## 0.个人介绍

哈喽大家好我是ysyms，一个专注于ICP的youtuber。这是我的ICNS主页：[ysyms.icp.page](ysyms.icp.page)

## 1. 目标

1.提高动议提案的参与度
2.提高参与动议提案神经元的投票奖励

## 2. 提案的背景和动机

1.在动议提案的权重提高之后，即使dfinity已经开始投票，动议提案的投票参与度依然不足50%，
2.在提案权重更改后，每周后的汇率提案总权重为10，每周维护提案的总权重将在5到30之间（数据来源于34485提案），而每个动议提案的权重为20。每周除动议类型以外的提案总权重为30左右
3.发起一个动议提案的成本为1个icp（如果得到执行那么将是0成本）
4.每日神经元奖励根据权重来分配

综上所述：我们只需要每天发起两个动议提案那么每周的动议提案就可以占到90%左右的总权重，积极投票的神经元将获得NNS所有增发ICP的百分之90%作为收益。根据第一点，参与动议提案投票的神经元只有不到50%，所以我每天只需要花费2个icp的成本就可以将0.059%的日收益增加到0.106%左右，这会使积极投票的神经元（也就是你们）的收益提升1.8倍，而这一切只需要2个icp和输入一些命令，这是一件很伟大的事，你觉得呢？

这对icp的鲸鱼来说这将有利可图，我不明白为什么没有人这样做，也许是因为我对NNS的理解有些错误。所以我将在接下来的七天内验证它。

## 3. 我将要做 

不管该提案是否通过，在接下来的7天中我都将会在NNS每天发表两个动议提案用于验证结论的正确性
我每天都在关注IC及其生态发展，我会尽量发一些有意义的提案。打扰了抱歉

## 4. 常见问题

这对不投票的神经元很不公平吗？
我认为这很公平。NNS是一个治理系统，如果一个神经元只为了被动收益，不关心权重的更改，不关心IC的治理，甚至不愿意去随手跟随一个神经元投票，那么它不应该获得收益，更不应该获得更多控制ICP的权力。所以我认为目前每天发起两个动议提案对ICP来说是利大于弊的，这可以很大程度上增加神经元的投票意愿，提高社区积极性，并让ICP增发给积极参治理的人。
请检查52214提案，dfinity和ica和icpmn和cycledao.xyz都投了"no"，但即便如次整个提案的参与度仍然不足50%。我们也许永远用不到"绝对多数"。

这可以通过提高发起提案的门槛来避免吗？
也许可以避免我，但无法避免巨鲸，也会让治理变得更加独裁

这可以通过降低动议提案的权重来避免吗？
也许吧，参考：在动议提案的权重得到提升前，动议提案的投票参与度只有百分之十左右。

## 5.结语

请原谅我使用那么奇怪的格式发起提案，我是一个高中生并非开发者，今天刚学会了一点markdown，抱歉

14个icp足够我一个月生活费了，七天内，如果您因此获利或认同我的观点，请积极的提出和表决动议提案。

如果您认为提案流程过于繁琐，可以向该地址转入ICP： `a367ed0ae66218194aafc9fb484dd78cc78fa28b57f4cc69b106e6aafd7403ea`，只要该账户的余额足够发起提案，那么以后我将每天坚持发两个动议提案。您也可以在转入ICP后将您想发的动议提案通过以下方式告诉我，我会帮你提交到NNS: [ysyms.icp.page](ysyms.icp.page)

在此期间，我的收入不会增加 14 ICP，因为我只有总额100多个ICP的神经元。

# A series of 3 other proposals are to be generated in regards with this proposal

##  Objective

This proposal is to delay the implementation of [Compounding Maturity](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/48623)

## background

There is too many uncertainty with the new rewards system. As an example, still, too (if not all) many people do not understand how the +5% or -5% works exactly.
There was no rush to proceed with the vote because those changes do not slow in any way the growth of the IC ecosystem. In fact, the complication of the new system may even cool off some investors (especially those who want to diligently pay their due taxes every year) from locking up their ICP.
And the delay voted in this first proposal would be until the second and thirs proposala are initiated and voted.

## A preview of the other two proposals

The second proposal would be to save the actual reward system as an option for investors locked already and want to calculate and pay their due taxes diligently, including the ICP selling requirement to do so. Right now, investors can calculate precisely everyday the value when they merge or mint their rewards with the daily price of ICP. If they do at noon everyday, always the same way, they obtain an accurate amount to report to their tax jurisdiction.

The third proposal would be to let investors to unlock their neurons (if the option 2 is voted NO) as there are important changes that interfere with the precise calculation of taxes. I believe Dfinity or other investors should not vote to interfere with the precise calculation of taxes, preventing investors to be crystal clear with their income tax reports. The year 2021, because of the actual system, is great in this view.

----

A fourth vote would possibly be done after a conversation here to define the role of Dfinity as far as programming and keep them away from taxes management programming.
The ultimate goal is to not interfere with investors that want pay their taxes precisely or let them out.
If you vote YES to this proposal, you want Dfinity to delay the implementation of the proposal 48623 until the second and third proposal as describe above are initiated and voted.
If you vote No to this proposal, you want the implementation of proposal 48623 to be processed as soon as available.

----

# 3.1 Recap on DFINITY Foundation"s vote on proposal #52564

![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FPdEqNhUcAAzBzp?format=jpg&name=large)
It looks like DFINITY and ICPMN and cycledao.xyz and dev.org have downvoted the #52564 proposal on the grounds that DFINITY believes that the proposal does not inspire a direction or dialogue to move the IC forward without a clear goal. So I would like to ask why you voted "yes" to the [#46398](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/46398) proposal [#46547](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/46547) proposal [#46700](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/46700) proposal [#46958](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/46985) proposal [#47098](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/47098) proposal [#47246](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/47246) proposal [#47394](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/47394) proposal? Is it just because the person who initiated the proposal is [ICPMN](https://twitter.com/BartlettWenzel?s=20&t=CVs0ync0NF20vy5s1J_FCg)? Is it because you discriminate against the Chinese community? Is it just because ICPMN made a relevant post in a centralized forum that caused community discussion? Why should the most advanced DAO in the world be discussed on a centralized platform? Do not you think it is good for your ICP to increase governance participation? Or do you think the ICP wik document is so well written that even kindergarten children can understand it so that my Chinese translation and video explanation are superfluous? the most advanced DAO in the world looks very inefficient and corrupt.

## It seems that some people simply do not realize that NNS is the most cost-effective way of spreading information in the world.
![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FPdYqy2aMAEvLPz?format=png&name=900x900)
The "List of Known Neurons" looks a lot like EOS supernodes, and you have natural exclusivity. You should put your neuron id on your official website and you should put your neuron id in your twitter profile. You should advertise in your own community, not on the front of NNS. It is like threatening users: Hurry up and pick one from the list, or you will lose your money if you miss the motion proposal. Users should be able to judge who has contributed to the ICP. According to historical data and information disclosed by DFINITY, the voting weight of neurons in the "known neuron list" is 33%, and the highest participation rate of motion proposals is only 45%, which means that they can pass any proposal. Everyone should know how high the authority of NNS is. Dominic, do not you think this needs to change? It looks more centralized than SOL.

Those forced to follow oligarchs for gain you have better selection neurons: `12860062727199510685`

 ## Why should I explain the vote in the proposal
 
 From the analysis of the design of NNS, there are only four cases for a proposal
 
1.You think this proposal is beneficial to your locked ICP, you should vote "yes"
2.You think the proposal is not conducive to your locked ICP, you should "no"
3.If you think the proposal has no effect on your locked ICP, it means that you think this is a spam proposal and you should vote "no"
4.You do not know how the proposal will affect your locked ICP, you should vote "no" in order to avoid risks
 
 I do not actually care about 1 ICP required to vote at all, you shouldn not be limited to a motion proposal being executed or rejected, NNS is not only the world"s most cost-effective way to disseminate information, it is the world"s best community survey Way.
 
 # Finally, the goal of this proposal is to remove the list of known neurons in the NNS front-end

# 3.1关于DFINITY基金会对#52564提案投票的回顾

![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FPdEqNhUcAAzBzp?format=jpg&name=large)
看起来DFINITY和ICPMN和cycledao.xyz和ICDevs.org对 #52564 提案投出了反投票，理由是DFINITY[认为](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/dfinity-foundations-voting-on-translation-of-how-to-create-an-nns-motion-proposal-52564/11847/2)该提案并没有激发方向或对话没有推动 IC 向前发展，没有一个目标。那么我想问你们为什么对[#46398](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/46398) 提案[#46547](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/46547)提案[#46700](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/46700)提案[#46958](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/46958)提案[#47098](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/47089)提案[#47246](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/47246)提案47394提案投出了"yes"？难道只是因为发起提案的人是[ICPMN](https://twitter.com/BartlettWenzel?s=20&t=CVs0ync0NF20vy5s1J_FCg)？难道是因为您歧视中文社区？难道只是因为ICPMN在一个中心化论坛中发出的相关帖子引起了社区讨论？请问世界上最先进的DAO为什么要在中心化平台上进行讨论？您难道不认为提高治理参与度利于您的ICP吗？还是说你们认为ICP wik文档写的非常棒，幼儿园的小朋友也可以看懂以至于我做中文翻译和视频讲解就是画蛇添足吗？大裁缝，世界上最先进的DAO看起来非常低效与腐败。

# 看起来某些人根本没有意识到NNS是世界上最划算的信息传播途径。
![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FPdYqy2aMAEvLPz?format=png&name=900x900)
“已知神经元列表”看起来很像EOS的超级节点，你们具有天然的排他性。您应该把您的神经元id放在您的官网上，您应该把您的神经元id放在您的推特简介中。您应该去自己的社区宣传，而不是放在NNS前端，这就像在威胁用户：快点在列表中选一个，不然错过了动议提案就没有收益。用户应该有能力判断到底谁为ICP做出了贡献。根据历史数据和DFINITY所透露的信息可知"已知神经元"列表中的神经元的投票权重占比为33%，而动议提案的最高参与度不过45%，这意味它们可以通过任何一个提案。大裁缝，您应该知道NNS的权限有多高，您不认为这需要改变吗？它看起来比SOL更中心化。

 为了收益而被迫跟随寡头的人您有了更好的选择:`Neuron id: 12860062727199510685`

 ## 为什么我要在提案中对投票进行解释

 从NNS的设计来分析，对以一项提案来说无非就四种情况
 
 1.你认为该提案利于你所锁定的ICP，你应该投"yes"
 2.你认为该提案不利于你锁定的ICP，你应该"no"
 3.你认为该提案对你锁定的ICP没有影响，则表明你认为这是一个垃圾提案，你应该投"no"
 4.你不知道该提案对你锁定的ICP有什么影响，为了未知避免风险您应该投"no"
 
 实际上我根本不在乎投票所需的1个ICP，您不应该对动议提案的认知局限于被执行或被拒绝，NNS不仅是世界上最划算的信息传播途径，还是世界上最好的社区调查方式。
 
 # 最后，本提案的目标是删除已知神经元列表

Motivation: Upgrade the subnet 0 (tdb26) to rc--2022-03-24_18-31
   

# 3.2 Let us get to know NNS again

## What can NNS do?

NNS controls the cycle exchange rate, NNS controls the node machine, NNS can modify the token economy at will, NNS can change your private key, and NNS can delete the canister. Actually NNS controls everything about ICP.

## Who controls NNS?

1. DFINITY has neurons that account for 22% of the total stake
2. The maximum participation rate for motion proposals is 45%
3. For proposals other than motion types, DFINITY holds more than 90% of the voting weight

It turns out that NNS is actually fully controlled by DFINITY

## What do you think of DFINITY"s abstention from certain governance proposals?

DFINITY does this just to look a little decentralized. As I said earlier, in fact, DFINITY currently completely controls the ICP. As long as DFINITY wants, he can freeze your account at any time.The promise of a truly decentralized system that I need instead of a centralized institution

## Let us review the proposal "On Lowering the Technical Barrier for Initiating Motion Proposals"

![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FPeieTPakAA-GTN?format=jpg&name=large)

It looks like my conclusion in proposal #53013 is correct, oligarchs are inherently exclusive and they do not want more people to learn how to initiate proposals. Oh, and it is also possible that they do not dare to vote on proposals that criticize DFINITY" yes", after all DFINITY is the real controller.

If the ICP really restructured most of the world"s internet services, the NNS would be the world government, but at the moment this government seems to be more centralized than the North Korean government. I do not seem to see any plans for an NNS system on DFINITY"s roadmap.
If NNS can not change the status quo as soon as possible, what can ICP do to reconstruct most of the Internet services in the world? If NNS can not change the status quo as soon as possible, what is the difference between 100% running on the chain and 100% running on AWS? How can you build a decentralized application on a blockchain controlled by a centralized oligarch?
What is the point of integrating ICP with BTC? Threshold ECDSA signature looks very secure, but in fact it is indistinguishable from "WBTC secured by DFINITY".


## DFINITY seems to no care a lot about the design of NNS:

0. Oligopoly Control

1. Bad NNS frontend

2. Proposal Initiation Process Against Humanity

3. The NNS that fully controls the ICP doesn"t even appear in DFINITY"s roadmap and long-term R&D proposals, it looks like DFINITY thinks the current NNS works well.

# What is wrong with NNS front end?

1. The NNS front end is extremely slow
2. The UI is ugly
3. The NNS front end has various errors in the layout of the proposal, and it is completely unsuitable for reading the proposal
4. If you are using the NNS frontend to read this proposal you will not be able to open this link
5. So far, the front end of NNS still cannot re-invest automatically. I do not know for whom the "deployed" that DFINITY said is deployed for.
6. There is no one-click copy button for principal id
7. No one-click copy button for neurons id
8. There is no one-click copy button for canister id

# It is been almost a year since the mainnet went live, and the NNS frontend doesn"t seem to have improved much. How can you make the DAO that controls the ICP look like this? If possible, please DFINITY dismiss the NNS front-end team

# The goal of this proposal is to use 1 ICP to publish the content of this proposal on NNS, obviously I have achieved my goal

---

# 3.2让我们重新认识一下NNS

## NNS可以做什么？

NNS控制着cycle汇率，NNS控制着节点机，NNS可以随意修改代币经济，NNS可以改变您的私钥，NNS可以删除canister。实际上NNS控制着ICP的一切。

## NNS由谁来控制？

1.DFINITY拥有占质押总数22%的神经元
2.动议提案的最高参与度为45%
3.对于除了动议类型之外的提案DFINITY占有90%以上的投票权重

结果很明显NNS实际上由DFINITY完全控制

## 怎么看待DFINITY对某些治理提案弃权？

DFINITY这样做只是为了看起来有点去中心化而已，正如刚才说的，实际上DFINITY目前完全控制着ICP，只要DFINITY想，那么他可以随时冻结掉您的账户。我需要的真正去中心化的系统而不是中心化机构的承诺

## 让我们回顾一下"关于降低发起动议提案的技术门槛"的提案

![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FPeieTPakAA-GTN?format=jpg&name=large)

看起来我在#53013提案中的结论是正确的，寡头具有天然的排他性，他们不希望更多的人学会如何发起提案. 哦，还有一种可能是，他们不敢对批评DFINITY的提案投"yes"，毕竟DFINITY才是真正的控制者。

如果ICP真的重构了世界上大多数互联网服务，那么NNS将会是世界政府，但目前来看这个政府似乎比朝鲜政府更加中心化。在DFINITY的路线图上，我似乎并没有看到对NNS系统有什么规划。
如果NNS不能尽快改变现状，ICP拿什么重构世界上大多数互联网服务，如果NNS不能尽快改变现状，dominic所说的100%在链上运行和100%在aws运行有什么区别？您怎么能在被中心化寡头控制的区块链上构建去中心化应用呢？
ICP与BTC集成又有什么意义？阈值ECDSA签名看起来非常安全，但实际上它和"由DFINITY担保的WBTC"相比没有什么区别。


## DFINITY似乎很不在意对NNS的设计:

0.寡头控制

1.糟糕的NNS前端

2.反人类的提案发起程序

3.完全控制着ICP的NNS甚至没有出现在DFINITY的路线图与长期研发的提案中，看起来DFINITY认为目前的NNS工作良好。


# NNS前端有哪有问题

1. NNS前端速度极其缓慢
2. UI丑陋无比
3. NNS前端对提案的排版有各种错误，并且完全不适合阅读提案
4. 如果你在使用NNS前端阅读本提案您将无法打开此链接
5. 到目前为止NNS前端依然无法自动复投，我不知道DFINITY所说的"已部署"究竟在为谁部署。
6. 没有对principal id的一键复制按钮
7. 没有对neurons id的一键复制按钮
8. 没有对canister id的一键复制按钮

# 主网上线已经快一年了，NNS前端看起来没有什么改进。您怎么能把控制着ICP的DAO做成这个样子？如果可以，请DFINITY辞退NNS前端团队
# 本提案的目标就是使用一个ICP把本提案的内容发在NNS上，很显然我已经实现了我的目标

# 4.1 Let us get to know the list of known neurons outside of DFINITY again

## I saw ICPMN" [explanation](https://forum.dfinity.org/) of the vote for "Please lower the technical threshold for initiating motion proposals" (#52742):

1.cycle_dao and ICdev.org actually follow the ICPMN vote (it looks like the actual situation is more centralized)
2.ICPMN actually agrees with what proposal [#52742](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/52742) says to lower the technical threshold for initiating motion proposals.
3.The reason why ICPMN voted "no" is because I didn"t start a discussion on the forum before sending the proposal

## Why I vote against ICPMN"s vote on this proposal

1. The vote for this proposal before the ICPMN vote is 5.6:2.1
2. As mentioned earlier, "ICPMN believes that it must be discussed in the forum before voting for this proposal." If DFINITY abstains, then ICPMN will control the NNS motion proposal (relevant data: In proposal #52742, ICPMN has 8% of the total voting weight, accounting for 51% of the total voting weight of proposal #52742. For proposal [#52579](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/52579), vote in ICPMN Previously, the voting ratio of this proposal was 7.4:3.8. After the ICPMN vote, the voting ratio of this proposal was 7.4:11.9. Similarly, ICPMN neurons have 8% of the total voting weight, accounting for 41% of the total participation in the #52579 proposal) . This means that if DFINITY abstains, even if your proposal can get the absolute advantage of the community 5.6:2.1 or 7.4:3.8, you must go to the forum to initiate a discussion in accordance with the requirements of ICPMN before it can be passed, which goes against the design of NNS.
3. Since you agree with the goals of the proposal, you should not reject the proposal for an unspecified reason. You should be aware that if DFINITY abstains you actually control the NNS motion proposal, until the NNS system is improved, you should be responsible for a decentralized system, and your rejection is not only your own rejection, but NNS"s refusal, and the reason for this refusal is not part of NNS"s design at all, but your own regulations, and it seems that you are helping NNS to decide.

## ICPMN can vote "no" because NNS is free to vote.

1.You have 41%-51% of the voting weight for a proposal that DFINITY abstains from. You can arbitrarily decide on NNS proposals with a reason that is not within the design of NNS. This can only mean that NNS is currently an oligarch-controlled DAO, and now it seems that there are not five oligarchs, but two, one DFINITY and one ICPMN. , when DFINITY is inconvenient to make decisions, the proposal can be controlled by ICPMN again.

While current technology-related proposals must rely on DFINITY, motion proposals do not need to rely on ICPMN.

## ICPMN community members can freely decide their own votes

1. Judging from the data, it seems that the votes of ICPMN community members cannot affect the voting results
2. This proposal only analyzes the ICPMN neurons in the "known Neuron List"

# Answer questions from the community

### 1. #52742 Proposal has no relevant technical details

1. The motion proposal does not have any code upgrades
2. The proposal is only a goal rather than a specific implementation plan
3. Before making a specific implementation plan, you should first let DFINITY know whether the community needs it or not (as the #53013 proposal says, NNS is the best community survey method in the world).

### 2. #52742 Proposal is not guaranteed to be implemented even if passed

1. It doesn"t need to be guaranteed to execute, it just needs to let DFINITY know if we need it.

2. How long has it been since the "ICP Integration BTC" proposal passed? Is it delayed? Is it guaranteed to be enforced? If DFINITY announces that the research and development of "ICP integrated BTC" is stopped due to technical reasons, can the results of the original proposal guarantee the implementation of the proposal?

# The goal of this proposal is to spend 1 ICP to post this proposal on the world"s most cost-effective information dissemination platform。At the same time, whether to delete the "known neuron list as a data reference"

# 让我们再次认识DFINITY之外的"已知神经元列表

## 我看到了ICPMN对"Please lower the technical threshold for initiating motion proposals"（#52742）投票的解释：

1.cycle_dao和ICdev.org实际上跟随ICPMN投票（看起来实际情况更加中心化）
2.ICPMN实际上同意 [#52742](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/52742)提案所说的降低发起动议提案的技术门槛。
3.ICPMN之所以投"no"是因为我没有在发提案前在forum发起讨论

## 为什么我反对ICPMN神经元对 #52742提案的投票

1.在ICPMN投票之前该提案的投票情况是5.6:2.1

2.正如前面所说"ICPMN认为必须需要经过forum讨论才会对该提案投yes"。如果DFINITY弃权，那么ICPMN将控制NNS动议提案（相关数据：在#52742提案中，ICPMN拥有8%的总投票权重，占 #52742提案总参与投票权重的51%。[#52742](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/52742)提案的总投票参与度为19.2% ，在ICPMN投票前，该提案的投票情况为7.4：3.8，在ICPMN投票后，该提案的投票情况为7.4：11.9，同样ICPMN神经元拥有8%的总投票权重，占 [#52579](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/52579)提案总参与度的41%）。这意味着，如果DFINITY弃权，即使您的提案可以得到社区5.6:2.1或7.4:3.8的绝对优势，您也要必须按照ICPMN的要求去forum发起讨论后才能通过，这违背了NNS的设计。

3.您既然同意该提案的目标，就不应该以一个没有具体规定的理由来拒绝这个提案。您应该意识到，如DFINITY弃权您实际上控制着NNS的动议提案，在NNS系统得到改进之前，您应该对一个去中心化系统负责，你的拒绝不仅是代表着自己的拒绝，而是代表着NNS的拒绝，而这种拒绝的理由根本不属于NNS的设计，而是你自己的规定，看起来，你正在帮助NNS出决定。

## ICPMN 的社区成员可以自由的决定自己的投票

1.从区块浏览器的数据来看，ICPMN的社区成员的投票似乎无法影响到投票结果
2.本提案只对“已经神经元列表"中的ICPMN神经元做出分析

## ICPMN 可以投"no"，因为NNS可以自由投票。

对于一个DFINITY弃权的提案您拥有41%-51%的投票权重。您用一个没有在NNS设计之内的理由就可以随意决定NNS提案，这只能说明目前NNS就是一个寡头控制的DAO罢了，而且现在看起来不是五个寡头，而是2个，一个DFINITY一个ICPMN，当DFINITY不方便做出决策时，提案便可又ICPMN控制。

虽然目前技术相关的提案必须依赖DFINITY，但动议提案并不需要依赖ICPMN。

# 回答来自社区的问题

### 1.#52742提案没有相关的技术细节

1.动议提案没有任何代码升级
2.该提案只是一个目标而不是具体的实现方案
3.在做具体的实现方案之前，应该首先让DFINITY知道社区到底需不需要它（正如#53013提案所说，NNS是世界上最好的社区调查方式）。

### 2.#52742提案即使通过也不能保证被执行

1.它不需要被保证执行，它只需要让每个人都知道我们是否需要它

2."ICP集成BTC"提案通过多久了？它延迟了吗？它保证被执行了吗？如果DFINITY宣布"ICP集成BTC"由于技术原因停止研发，当初的提案的结果是否可以保证提案的执行？

# 本提案的目标就是花费1 ICP将本提案发在世界上最划算的信息传播平台上，同时为是否要删除"已知神经元列表做数据参考“


  

# This proposal is a spam proposal

Since there are other things to do today, but in order to fulfill the promise of proposal 52579, had to send a garbage proposal.
You should vote "no" for this proposal


# but not completely garbage

1. The daily governance proposal will increase the income of the giant whale by more than 100 icp
2. This may be unavoidable if the NNS does not modify the design

---


# 本提案是一个垃圾提案

由于今天有些其他事情要做，但为了兑现52579提案的承诺，不得不发一个垃圾提案。
对于本提案您应该投"no"


# 但不完全垃圾

1.每天的治理提案会让巨鲸增加100icp以上的收入
2.如果NNS不修改设计，这可能是无法避免的。

Motivation: Upgrade the subnet 15 (pjljw) to rc--2022-01-21_18-30
                      # Update the GuestOS firewall rules to prepare for switching to the VM-based boundary nodes

To be able to switch to the open-source VM-based boundary nodes, with the final goal of decentralizing the boundary nodes, we need to allow the existing GuestOS nodes to peer with the new boundary node VMs by updating the GuestOS firewall rules.

Here are the IPv6 prefixes that we add since the last firewall update proposal [51043](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/51043):

```
2604:1380:4601:6201::/64
2604:1380:4601:6202::/64
2604:1380:4641:6101::/64
2604:1380:4641:6102::/64
2604:1380:4091:3001::/64
2604:1380:4091:3002::/64
2604:1380:45e1:a601::/64
2604:1380:45e1:a602::/64
```

The 8 prefixes above are for the 8 new boundary node VMs. Each VM is executed on a dedicated machine. The change is necessary to enable the new boundary node VMs to establish connections to the replicas.
 # Replace a node in subnet pjljw.

- Step 1 (this proposal): Add nodes [k654q-za4wi-utgmv-7mnhq-ipav4-5l4l7-6rzao-r4spd-rnkqf-5ljy2-5ae]
- Step 2 (upcoming proposal): Remove nodes [wxcyn-o2lwu-2ifqv-2xruo-so5kt-lszm3-awh2q-dbhbd-weojc-t5kms-2ae]


Motivation: Canary deployment of the new method for the decentralized node deployment. This new method will allow Node Providers to independently deploy new nodes, from an open-source USB image.

It seems that the ["Reset Followees for the "All Topics Except Governance" Category"](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/community-discussion-revise-governance-voting-rewards-to-fix-proposal-spamming-rewards-exploit/11915/26) proposal can be a good solution to the reward problem

# But this doesn"t really prevent spam proposals, because in addition to that, spam proposals have the following motivations

1. You will have to pay attention to the motion proposal due to weight issues, which makes the motion proposal a broadcast of the community

2. The purpose of garbage proposals is not to be executed but to be seen by the community

## How to use $34,000 to conduct a spam proposal attack on NNS. (I will not implement this attack at the moment)

### For proposers:

1. The proposer uses USD 34,000 to buy 1,700 ICPs, the daily interest is 1ICP, and the proposer will get the right to propose every day.
2. The purpose of the proposer can be to make ICP better, to spread their own ideas, to promote products, or to defraud the community.
3. The growth of the ICP token price does not prevent this attack, and as the ICP price grows, the influence of the motion proposal will also grow.

### To voters

1. Due to the weight of the motion proposal, voters will be forced to view the content of the motion proposal and vote on it every day. At this point, most of the attacker"s goals have been completed
2. Since the motion proposal has no content restrictions, voters will see various information, such as pornographic, bloody content

### For stakers

1. If he does not vote on the motion proposal, then he will give up most of the proceeds
2. If he does not want to give up his gains, then he must vote every day.
3. He can manually vote every day and encounter the problems that voters will encounter, or he can choose any one in the "known neuron list" to follow (this will be the choice of most people, and this is what I recommend The main reason for deleting the "known neuron list" of the motion proposal, especially when the "automatic reinvestment" function is completed, ordinary investors will lose the motivation to participate in governance, he only needs to buy ICP, lock ICP, and turn on automatic reinvestment. To cast, randomly select a neuron to follow in the list of known neurons. Then NNS will not be a governance system for him, but a financial management tool. PS: At present, many people do this)

### For NNS

1. Most neurons will not be able to bear to read proposals and vote on motion proposals every day, they will choose to follow the neurons in the "known neuron list".
2. The attack only needs $34,000 to make NNS very centralized

## Several possible solutions to avoid this attack

1. Review the content of the proposal in various ways.
2. Increase the funding threshold for initiating proposals.
3. Decrease the weight of motion proposals.
4. DFINITY has mentioned the mechanism of the spam prevention proposal in the roadmap. I would like to know how it is designed. I hope DFINITY will announce more information as soon as possible.

# You may have realized the seriousness of the problem, please express your opinion:
https://forum.dfinity.org/t/how-to-use-34-000-to-conduct-a-spam-proposal-attack-on-nns-i-will-not-implement-this-attack-at-the-moment/11958

看起来["Reset Followees for the “All Topics Except Governance" Category"](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/community-discussion-revise-governance-voting-rewards-to-fix-proposal-spamming-rewards-exploit/11915/26)提案可以很好的解决的奖励问题

# 但这不能真正避免垃圾提案，因为除此之外，垃圾提案还会有以下动机

1.由于权重问题您将不得不关注动议提案，这让动议提案成为社区的广播

2.垃圾提案的目的并不是被执行而是被社区看到


# 如何使用34000美金对NNS进行垃圾提案攻击. (我目前不会实施该攻击)

### 对于提案者:

1.提案者使用34000美金购买1700个ICP，每日利息为1ICP，提案者将每天获得提案权。
2.提案者的目的可以是使ICP变得更好，也可以是为了传播自己的思想，也可以是为了推广产品，更可以为了欺诈社区。
3.ICP令牌价格的增长并不能避免这种攻击，随着ICP价格的增长，动议提案的影响力也会增长。

### 对着投票者

1.由于动议提案的权重问题，投票者将被迫每天查看动议提案的内容并对此投票。到此，攻击者的大部分目的已经完成
2.由于动议提案没有内容限制，投票者会看到各种信息，如色情、血腥内容

### 对于普通的质押人

1.如果他不对动议提案投票，那么他将放弃大部分收益
2.如果他不想放弃收益，那么他必须每天投票。
3.他可以每天手动投票，并遇到投票者会遇到的问题，也可以在"已知神经元列表"中随便选择一个进行跟随(这将会是大部分人的选择，这也是我建议删除动议提案的"已知神经元列表"的主要原因,特别是当"自动复投"功能完成时，普通投资者将失去参与治理的动力，他只需要买入ICP，锁定ICP，开启自动复投，在已知神经元列表中随机选择一个神经元进行跟随。那么NNS对于他来说将不是一个治理系统，而是一个理财工具。P.S.：目前很多人就是这么做的)

### 对于NNS

1.大部分神经元将无法忍受每天阅读提案并对动议提案进行投票，他们将会选择跟随"已知神经元列表"中的神经元。
2.该攻击只需要34000美金就会使NNS变得非常中心化

## 避免该攻击的几种可能的方案

1.对提案内容进行各种方式的审查。
2.增加发起提案的资金门槛。
3.降低动议提案的权重。
4.DFINITY在路线图中有提到到预防垃圾提案的机制，我很想知道它是如何设计的，希望DFINITY尽早公布更多信息

#  您可能已经意识到了问题的严重程度，您可以在此参与讨论:
https://forum.dfinity.org/t/how-to-use-34-000-to-conduct-a-spam-proposal-attack-on-nns-i-will-not-implement-this-attack-at-the-moment/11958/8

   

Since I am the planner of the attack, I also have a solution that I think is a good solution. But the community doesn"t seem to agree with many of my suggestions, and DFINITY has its own plans for this, so I am not going to announce it anytime soon

------

由于我是攻击方案的策划者，所以我还有着一个我认为很好的解决的方案。但社区似乎不认同的我的许多建议，并且DFINITY对此有自己的计划，所以我不打算近期公布它.

I think that is a good suggestion. Also consider adding a shortcut button for "Show only governance proposals"

(I also think that too much discussion of this kind of proposal will only reduce the efficiency of the DAO)

###### Note: This proposal comes from the community, and the content of the proposal has nothing to do with [ysyms](https://ysyms.icp.page/)

## Objective:

Dfinity to not interfere with tax payer who want to pay their taxes precisely and genuinely (IRS in USA and other tax jurisdiction) as planned in proposal 48623

## Background:

The reason the creator of this proposal have decided to avoid discussion on the Dfinity forum is that there should be any debate in regards to taxpayer who want be honest and pay their taxes diligently and precisely.
The proposal [#48623](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/48623) clearly state (by Jwiegley) that tax burden is a problem to solve. See section ‘Problem’. As this proposal see the tax system as a burden, some investors see it as a necessity in their community, country. Some investors also believe that everyone should pay their fair share amount of taxes as required by laws in their jurisdiction.
Post 108 on thread "request-for-feedback-compounding-maturity-proposal" on Dfinity forum from Dominicwilliams
"In the proposal, when maturity is used to produce new ICP, the quantity of ICP created some days in the future is modulated by ICP price trends. This makes it near impossible for tax authorities to draw a simple equivalence between increased maturity and ICP tokens received and thus claim that maturity represents income received that has created a tax liability. I hope that the foregoing highlights why this is important for large parts of the community, in order to help prevent them being exposed to unavoidable tax liabilities they have no control over"
Also in the same post:” For such reasons, I realized that an analysis of the current situation should be provided, to provide those in this situation with input material that might be supplied to tax advisors and/or tax lawyers. In addition, I realized that the design should be further hardened, to make it even more difficult for any tax authority around the world to claim that increases in maturity represent ordinary income that should be immediately taxed.”
Post 245 on thread "request-for-feedback-compounding-maturity-proposal" on Dfinity forum from Jwiegley "The reason the modulation exists at all is to induce uncertainty in the amount received. If it could be known in advance, there would be no reason for it."
For some investors who are staked in the NNS with no possibility to get out, this is a tax interference for tax payors who believe all rewards, in any form, are taxable and want to pay their taxes precisely according to their jurisdiction law.
This proposal creator believe Dfinity and his community should program functions to make the annual tax report easier, not harder and provide tools such as daily reports, etc.

## Proposal:

This proposal is for Dfinity to leave all actual functions in the NNS as is and to avoid any rewards modulation (5% proposed) so investors can produce appropriate tax report to their respective jurisdiction. It would let investors keep managing the exact same way as before as an option

Thanks to [kylelangham](https://twitter.com/kylelangham?s=20&t=GsGoEirGdAUt4rE-0j7Mhw)  for the data, however, he can only prove two things

1. This is the result of random selection from the oligopoly list after people find that the returns are decreasing
2. This proves that it is feasible to centralize NNS through extreme content attacks

In addition, allowing oligarchs to add more oligarchs will not decentralize NNS, and a neuron must be approved by other oligarchs to join the list, which is the practice of consortium chains. I guess it is because you have lived in a centralized society for so long that you do not know how to make a decentralized system

感谢[kylelangham](https://twitter.com/kylelangham?s=20&t=GsGoEirGdAUt4rE-0j7Mhw)提供的数据，不过，他只能证明两件事

 1. 这是人们发现收益减少后再寡头列表随机选择的结果
 2. 这证明通过极端内容攻击可以NNS中心化是可行的

此外让寡头们添加更多的寡头不会让NNS去中心化，一个神经元要加入列表必须经过其他寡头的同意，这是联盟链的做法。我猜测是因为你们在中心化的社会中生活太久了导致不知道应该怎么做出一个去中心化系统

  Update subnet lhg73-sax6z-2zank-6oer2-575lz-zgbxx-ptudx-5korm-fy7we-kh4hl-pqe to replica version dfdba729414d3639b2a6c269600bbbd689b35385

Motivation: Upgrade the subnet 13 (lhg73) to rc--2022-04-06_18-32
 Update subnet opn46-zyspe-hhmyp-4zu6u-7sbrh-dok77-m7dch-im62f-vyimr-a3n2c-4ae to replica version dfdba729414d3639b2a6c269600bbbd689b35385

Motivation: Upgrade the subnet 21 (opn46) to rc--2022-04-06_18-32
 Update subnet 3hhby-wmtmw-umt4t-7ieyg-bbiig-xiylg-sblrt-voxgt-bqckd-a75bf-rqe to replica version dfdba729414d3639b2a6c269600bbbd689b35385

Motivation: Upgrade the subnet 30 (3hhby) to rc--2022-04-06_18-32
    Remove node(s) gqy2c-5ga5z-7gaqn-o3ngh-ucmxe-eydmw-c3kp2-bvm4o-jbq2k-bgk6p-hqe from the Registry.

Motivation: Remove offline nodes from the network
    
 

I want to clarify it.

1. 13897053307110729737 Neuron is not me
2. This is not a garbage proposal attack. Because my proposal account received 20 ICPs, just asked # 52579 proposal, if you do not solve the reward problem, I will stop the proposal until the balance of the proposal account will stop initiating proposal.
3. Garbage proposal attacks The true threat of NNS is to make the voters who are willing to manually vote by initiating extreme content proposals. They can only choose the neurons in the oligarchy list.

In addition, increasing the fund threshold of the proposal does not avoid garbage proposal attacks.

A: Hello Eth holder, what do you need to be able to attack the ETH
B: You may need at least 51% of force

A: Hello ICP holder, what do you need to attack an IC network?
C: You need to accounted for 0.0006% of the total quantity, then send extreme content attacks every day, you can make NNS to be centralized, but recently they may increase this cost to 0.006%, um, it looks very safe ( ICP Total Staked is 267688273)

I remember that the XXX is not the practice of democracy,  If the dollar is very good, what should we do to do BTC?

我想澄清一下

1. 13897053307110729737神经元不是我
2. 这不是垃圾提案攻击，因为我的提案账户收到了20个ICP，正如#52579提案中所说，如果不解决奖励问题，我会直到提案账户余额不足才会停止发起提案
3. 垃圾提案攻击对nns真正的威胁是通过发起极端内容提案使愿意手动投票的投票者被迫放弃手动投票，只能选择跟随寡头列表中的神经元

此外增加提案的资金门槛并不能避免垃圾提案攻击

A:你好ETH持有人，请问需要怎么做才能攻击以太坊网络
B:你可能需要至少51%的算力

A:你好ICP持有人，请问需要怎么做攻击IC网络
B:你需要占总质押量0.0006%的ICP，然后每天发送极端内容攻击，就可以使得NNS变得中心化，不过最近他们可能会将此成本提高到0.006%，嗯，它看起来非常安全（ICP总质押量为267688273）

# Review the security issues of ICP

Well, NNS really ca not modify the private key, but NNS can modify the II"s seed phrase and delete the II"s login device, you can learn more information through this post: [My NNS has been stolen, Please help me](https: https://forum.dfinity.org/t/my-nns-has-been-stolen-please-help-me/7896)
In addition, the law cannot protect the blockchain. At present, DFINITY certainly has no motivation to attack IC, but no one can guarantee that the neurons of DFINITY and ICA will not be attacked.
The entire IC is built on trust in DFINITY and ICA neurons, and attackers can destroy the entire network as long as they control these two neurons.

Chain key cryptography, threshold ECDSA signatures, @#%&... are all being controlled by this bad NNS. This leads to the fact that the actual security of the entire chain is not as good as a multi-signature wallet. The current design of NNS requires everyone to trust DFINITY and future development organizations, how can it be safe? No one is accusing ICP of centralization, it is just a fact.

If you do not believe what I said, you can wait until the IC is attacked and then look at this proposal

# 回顾一下ICP的安全问题

好吧，NNS确实不能修改私钥，但是NNS可以修改II的种子短语可以删除II的登录设备，您可以通过这个帖子了解更多信息:[My NNS has been stolen,Please help me](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/my-nns-has-been-stolen-please-help-me/7896)
此外，法律无法保护区块链，目前DFINITY当然没有攻击IC的动机，但是没有人能保证DFINITY与ICA的神经元不会被攻击。
整个IC都建立在对DFINITY与ICA神经元的信任之上，攻击者只要控制了这两个神经元就可以毁掉整个网络。

chain key密码学、阈值ECDSA签名、@#%&……，都在被这个糟糕的NNS控制。这导致整条链的实际安全性还不如一个多签钱包。当前NNS的设计要求所有人必须信任DFINITY和未来的开发组织，它怎么可能安全呢？没有人指控ICP中心化，这不过是事实。

如果你不相信我说的，可以等IC被攻击后再来看这个提案

    
 
I want to warn some people in the community

You support increasing the complexity of the motion proposal
You request that the motion proposal must go through forum discussion
You fully trust DFINITY and future development organizations on other proposals

Actually only other proposals really control the ICP
In fact, you have completely abandoned the decentralization and security of IC

Decentralized aws? No, it is currently the multisignature version aws

-----

我想警告社区的某些人

你支持增加动议提案的复杂度
你要求动议提案必须经过审议
你在其他提案上完全信任DFINITY和未来的开发组织

实际上只有其他提案才真正控制着ICP
实际上你已经完全放弃了IC的去中心化与安全性

去中心化的aws？不，它目前是多签版本的aws.

"Neurons can freely choose which ones to follow, this is not the fault of NNS，&#￥@…"
First, it is not really the problem

Second, blockchain explorers are not charged: 55% of neurons are not involved in motion proposals, do you think they will modify their follow state for other proposals? The fact is that even if someone announces that they control the neurons of DFINITY and ICA and want to attack IC, the remaining 55% neurons will not modify the follow state. Attackers can easily reach a "supermajority"

The fork of the blockchain is different from the NNS proposal. The fork will not affect the data before the fork, and NNS can directly modify the data on the chain.The problem with NNS is that security is built on trust in the neurons organized by the developers of the ICP. Even if there are more development organizations (20?) in the future, IC only has multi-signature security.

NNS lacks a safety mechanism, and other proposals cannot be implemented immediately even if they reach an "absolute majority". A motion proposal should have the power to suspend the execution of other proposals.

# "神经元可以自由选择要跟随的神经元，这不是NNS的错&#￥@…"

首先，这不是真正的问题

第二，区块链浏览器不是收费的：有55%的神经元没有参与动议提案，你认为他们会修改对其他提案的跟随状态吗？事实就是即使有人宣布控制了DFINITY和ICA的神经元，并要对IC进行攻击，剩下的55%神经元也不会修改跟随状态。攻击者可以轻松达到"绝对多数"

区块链的分叉和NNS的提案不一样，分叉不会影响分叉前的数据，NNS是可以直接修改链上数据。即使未来有更多的开发组织（20个？），IC也只有多签安全性。

NNS缺少一种安全机制，其他提案即使达到"绝对多数",也不可以立即执行，动议提案应该拥有暂停其他提案执行的权力。

  
 
Just a reminder to some people that you are seeing this spam proposal because of a bounty issue. If you do not want to see this proposal, you should think about how to solve the reward problem instead of how to review the proposal.

Note: Due to previous commitments, I had to use up the ICP in [Proposal Account](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/account/a367ed0ae66218194aafc9fb484dd78cc78fa28b57f4cc69b106e6aafd7403ea)

提醒一下某些人，您之所以能看到这个垃圾提案，是因为奖励问题。如果你不想看到这个提案，你应该去思考怎么解决奖励问题而不是怎么审查提案。

由于利益驱动，人们有一万种方法躲避审查。


注：由于之前的承诺，我必须用完[提案账户](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/account/a367ed0ae66218194aafc9fb484dd78cc78fa28b57f4cc69b106e6aafd7403ea)里面的ICP，


                                                                                                                     ## 1. Objective
This is a governance motion proposal to increase the rejection cost of NNS proposals from the current 1 ICP to 10 ICP.

## 2. Background
The NNS is the brain of the Internet Computer, and it relies on the neuron holders to carefully consider each proposal and cast an informed vote. Neuron holders are also financially incentivized to vote on all proposals, as not voting leads to reduced neuron rewards, meaning a neuron holder cannot simply ignore proposals. It is important that there are not too many proposals, as casting an informed vote is time consuming and the load on neuron holders must be manageable. To discourage “bad” proposals, there is a rejection cost: the neuron that creates a proposal will pay this fee if the proposal gets rejected. The rejection cost is currently set to 1 ICP. There is no fee for proposals that are accepted.

This proposal makes a failed proposal more expensive, which is expected to encourage people to first communicate with the community and gather support before actually submitting a proposal. Hopefully this leads to higher quality proposals and fewer proposals that end up getting rejected.

Why change this now? The rejection cost of 1 ICP is very low, but only recently has it become apparent that it is important enough to bring to a motion. Recently there have been many rejected NNS proposals, which caused us to submit this proposal now.

In the future, this rejection cost can be adjusted further in the upward or downward direction depending on what makes sense to the community.

## 3. Key Milestones
This proposal will be deliberated until the comments go quiet and will then be submitted to the NNS as a governance motion proposal. If it passes, then I will work with Dfinity to learn how to submit this proposal as a NetworkEconomics proposal or to ask Dfinity to submit it themselves.

## 4. Discussion leads
@LightningLad91 will lead discussion on this proposal and submit the NNS proposal.

## 5. Security concerns
No security concerns have been identified at this time.

## 6. What we are asking the community
Review comments, ask questions, provide actionable feedback
Vote accept or reject on NNS Motion.           
 
#### Hahaha, let us assume the increased proposal rejection cost is implemented.

If you also want to increase your daily earnings, you can donate to my proposal account using the following formula: a367ed0ae66218194aafc9fb484dd78cc78fa28b57f4cc69b106e6aafd7403ea

Once a month: [Amount of donations] = [Amount of stake ICP] * 0.01% 30
Once a week: [Amount of donations] = [Amount of stake ICP] * 0.01% 7
Once a day: [Amount of donations] = [Amount of stake ICP] * 0.01% 1

I only need to receive a daily 0.01% maturity donation of 0.05% of the total neurons per day to continue increasing the yield for you.

It looks like at least increasing the rejection cost of the proposal to 2000 ICP would stop me outright.

### 哈哈哈，我们假设增加提案拒绝成本的提案通过了。

如果你还想增加每日收益，您可以用以下公式的计算方式来向我的提案账户捐赠:a367ed0ae66218194aafc9fb484dd78cc78fa28b57f4cc69b106e6aafd7403ea

每月一次：捐赠数量=质押ICP的数量*0.01%  * 30
每周一次：捐赠数量=质押ICP的数量* 0.01% * 7
每天一次：捐赠数量=质押ICP的数量* 0.01% * 1

我只需要每天收到总量0.05%的神经元的每日0.01%的成熟度捐赠就可以继续为你们提高收益。

看起来至少要将拒绝成本增加到2000个ICP才能彻底阻止我。

### Help! Total of 71106.36 ICP Tokens of Pre-Sale Investment Not Received for 3 months. Request for DFINITY OFFICIAL and DFINITY Foundation to Assist Investigation.  

We are Hong Kong Napthin Capital and we participated in the Pre-sale round of DFINITY in 2018. Our account has not received any ICP tokens for the past three months since February 2022.  
We did a KYC verification through the email link sent by the project party in June 2021, and binded the wallet address used for the pre-sale round. Our KYC-certified wallet address is:    e0b0(e0b07d90f2a350996427c300cc9917f74320fd21f7f5d5bd33e3d10c2d6f7110). Every month, we would receive ICP tokens sent by account   e97e(e97e61e313c1a3833b817eb92b761eef648d55368a9f460495276b847cb49926). However we did not receive it in February, March and April of 2022. Thus, we checked the transaction records of account e97e and found some problems:  
 
[https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/account/e97e61e313c1a3833b817eb92b761eef648d55368a9f460495276b847cb49926](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/account/e97e61e313c1a3833b817eb92b761eef648d55368a9f460495276b847cb49926)
 
1. The Pre-sale tokens are not credited directly to our KYC account, but to account e97e first, and subsequently to our account e0b0;  
2. Account e97e did not transfer ICP to our KYC account e0b0 in February, March and April 2022. However, account e97e transferred 23702 ICPs to an account 9916 on 2022/3/17 06:52:44 UTC and 2022/4/12 17:09 respectively. But account 9916 is not ours.
 
Our question is: Why are the monthly pre-sale ICP neuron-unlocked tokens not directly sent to our KYC account e0b0 every month, but transferred to our KYC account via an intermediate account e97e that is susceptible to human intervention?  
 
On February 26, 2022, we reported the situation to support@dfinity.org through Mr. [Herbert](https://twitter.com/herbertyang?s=20&t=fEx0gucNzfD5xtQZQqu20Q), our person-in-charge in China. After support replied us via email on March 15, they went silent. As of today, the 16th of April, our doubts still have not been resolved.  
 
As such, here is a proposal to request DFINITY OFFICIAL and DFINITY Foundation for assistance in investigating the following:  
1. Is the account e97e officially controlled by the DFINITY OFFICIAL?  
2. If the account e97e is not officially controlled by the DFINITY OFFICIAL could the   foundation provide evidence? This is of utmost importance to us. Thank you!

#### Help! 2018年参与的Pre-sale投资最近三期累计71106.36个ICP没有收到，请Dfinity官方和Dfinity Foundation协助调查。
 
我们是Hong Kong Napthin Captial,参与了2018年Dfinity的Pre-sale round,我们的账号从2022年2月份开始已经有三期没有收到ICP。  
我们在2021年6月份通过项目方发的邮件链接做的KYC，同时绑定了发放预售轮的钱包地址，我们kyc认证的钱包地址:e0b0(e0b07d90f2a350996427c300cc9917f74320fd21f7f5d5bd33e3d10c2d6f7110），每个月我都会收到来自账号e97e（e97e61e313c1a3833b817eb92b761eef648d55368a9f460495276b847cb49926）发的icp，但是2022年的2月份、3月份、4月份我们都没有收到；我们去查了账号e97e的交易记录，发现了一些问题：
[https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/account/e97e61e313c1a3833b817eb92b761eef648d55368a9f460495276b847cb49926](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/account/e97e61e313c1a3833b817eb92b761eef648d55368a9f460495276b847cb49926)  
1、Pre-sale token没有直接发放到我们的kyc账号，而是先发放到账号e97e，再发到我的kyc账号e0b0；  
2、账号e97e在2022年2月份、3月份、4月份没有将icp转我的kyc账号e0b0，并且账号e97e分别在2022/3/17 06:52:44 UTC和2022/4/12 17:09:21 UTC转了23702icp到账号9916，但是账号9916不是我们的；
 
我们的疑问是：为什么每个月pre-sale的ICP神经元解锁不是直接发到我们的kyc账号e0b0，而是通过一个中间的可以被人为控制的账号e97e转到我们的kyc账号？  
 
2022年2月26号我们通过中国区负责人[herbert](https://twitter.com/herbertyang?s=20&t=fEx0gucNzfD5xtQZQqu20Q)先生将情况反馈给support@dfinity.org,3月15号support给我们回了邮件之后，就再也没有给我们回信息，截止到今天4月16号我们的疑问也没有得到解决？  
 
所以在这里发起提案，请求Dfinity官方和Dfinity Foundation协助调查以下内容：  
1、 账号e97e是否是你们官方控制的？  
2、 如果账号e97e不是你们官方控制的，能否提供证据证明，这个对我们很重要，谢谢！

我们IC真的是太去中心化了，寡头列表是世界上最好的设计，引用DFINITY的话"它只是为了方便用户"。

    

I am not keen to criticize the IC, I am just reminding some people not to forget the status quo of other proposals when revising the motion proposal

I think we can solve many problems by just resetting the follow state for all types of proposals once a year,Discussion link:[https://forum.dfinity.org/t/how-to-fix-the-spam-proposals-that-nns-is-currently-encountering/12248/5](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/how-to-fix-the-spam-proposals-that-nns-is-currently-encountering/12248/5)

我并不是热衷于批评IC，我只是提醒一下某些人在修改动议提案的时候不要忘记其他提案的现状，我认为通过每年重置所有类型提案的关注状态就可以解决许多问题，讨论链接:[https://forum.dfinity.org/t/how-to-fix-the-spam-proposals-that-nns-is-currently-encountering/12248/5](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/how-to-fix-the-spam-proposals-that-nns-is-currently-encountering/12248/5)


                                       Hi people :wave: , this is a known neuron proposal for my neuron. My name is Levi Feldman. If you like what I think, follow my votes. The neuron is: 11781217201066824825. 
You can contact me through the dfinity forum username: levi, or message me on Twitter: levifeldman. My dscvr username is: levs, my open chat username is: Levi, and my github username is: levifeldman.  # Proposal to establish a carbon footprint and sustainability policy for the Internet Computer

## Proposal

- Ask DFINITY to conduct a carbon footprint / environmental impact assessment - either through internal resources or hiring an external consultant to answer basic questions about what the carbon footprint of running a IC Subnet is, where that electricity is sourced, what the total cost per transaction is on the IC blockchain
- Ask DFINITY to add an “energy consumption” reporting panel to the IC Network Status dashboard

## Forum Discussion: 

https://forum.dfinity.org/t/sustainability-nns-proposal/11976

## Motivation

The goal of this proposal is to educate people that sustainability = environmental + social + economic impacts. Ideally the IC can address all of these impacts eventually, and this policy is starting by focusing on environmental impact.

“Going green” provides a marketing opportunity for The Internet Computer to enter the discussion around electricity usage and the blockchain. Solana’s report on electricity usage earlier this year made massive PR waves in the mainstream media outside of the crypto echo chamber. [(1) ](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/one-solana-transaction-uses-little-114956337.html)

In addition, discussion of Bitcoin and Eth’s POW model has become a toxic talking point about the evils of crypto - hard numbers and coherent talking points about IC’s policy on these issues would give our marketing a new major talking point to push. I want to be able to answer inquiries like this one from twitter with strong data and a clear message. [(2) ](https://twitter.com/Skeletoony/status/1505953212939001863)

Finally - my intention is that this proposal be structured to set a general direction for the Internet Computer when it comes to environmental concerns. The Internet Computer is currently positioning itself for massive breakout growth, and nothing in this proposal should slow or limit that growth. Instead it combines research and reporting with marketing and intention - we can look at the data that comes back and submit additional proposals related to this topic in the future. The Internet Computer was designed with energy efficiency in mind, and already claims “Systems built 100% on the Internet Computer run with efficiency comparable to the traditional IT stack, providing massive savings in costs and protecting the environment.” [(3) ](https://dfinity.org/icig.pdf) The Internet Computer is already a highly efficient green blockchain and web host. [(4) ](https://icpjesse.medium.com/crypto-in-the-age-of-climate-change-d3816bd016f9)This proposal aims to codify that fact, measure it, and officially promote it.

                             Over the next week or so, there will be several Motion proposals submitted to the NNS for consideration by the voting body regarding how to resolve the recent increase in non-actionable proposals.  The intent is for everyone to be able to evaluate each proposal on its own merit as well as relative to the other proposals.  Most of these proposals have been in deliberation on the forum for over a week and have gone through multiple iterations.  Links are provided below so you can begin researching how you might vote when each proposal is submitted.  Our hope is that DFINITY will provide feedback to the community on the technical feasibility of all the approved proposal(s), including technical trade-offs and opportunity costs. If needed, another proposal can be made by the community to refine the approved proposal(s) based on DFINITY’s feedback.

The proposals that are currently in deliberation include...

https://forum.dfinity.org/t/how-to-fix-the-spam-proposals-that-nns-is-currently-encountering/12248

                                              ## Objective

Decentralized governance cannot be fully achieved without very high participation rates from the voting body. We currently observe 45% of total voting power is cast on Governance proposals, but we have near 100% participation in All Topics Except Governance. The root cause of this discrepancy is that many neuron owners have not configured their neurons with a Followee for the Governance topic, yet they are receiving voting rewards because of default following that was configured for all neurons on the All Topics “catch-all” category. This discrepancy in participation rates is an incentive to submit spam proposals for the purpose of receiving higher voting rewards at the expense of others receiving lower voting rewards. This proposal aims to remove this incentive by establishing a minimum standard for active participation in governance that will strongly motivate all neuron owners to actively configure Followees and periodically confirm their selections.

**Proposal**: Require neuron owners to confirm their neuron Followee selections every 6 months. 

The recommended solution is to create a new button and countdown timer prominently displayed at the top of the Neurons tab in the NNS dApp (as well as a manage neuron command) that enables users to easily see how long they have to confirm their Followee selections and to easily perform the confirmation. The confirmation process should include a second confirmation pop up indicating what is being confirmed and why it is important to confirm Followees. It is acceptable for this confirmation to apply for all hotkey controlled neurons that are associated with the principal ID that is performing the confirmation (this avoids multiple confirmations for owners with a lot of neurons). When this confirmation button is first presented in the NNS dApp, all neuron owners should be allowed 1 month to confirm their neuron selections for the first time. All confirmations afterward shall occur at an interval of no longer than 6 months. When the confirmation button is clicked, the countdown timer is reset back to 6 months and begins counting down again. If a neuron holder modifies a followee for their neuron, the countdown timer is reset back to 6 months and begins counting down again. In the event that a neuron owner does not confirm Followee selections before the countdown timer expires, then all Followee designations shall be automatically removed from the neuron configuration. 

## Background

The driver for this proposal at this time is that it will remove incentives for spam proposals that are submitted to the NNS for the purpose of increased voting rewards. This will be explained below, but first it should be clarified that this change is much more important because it incentivizes further improvement toward decentralization. This feature will ensure that all governance participants make intentional decisions about their Followee selections on a regular basis, which should be the bare minimum requirement for active governance participation. ICP is a governance token and the tokenomics are designed to incentivize participation. Staking is not intended to be just a source of yield farming. We should expect that anyone who stakes must remain sufficiently active to know how to participate in governance and are doing so by this minimum standard of active participation.

This action also ensures that none of the publicly known neurons in the NNS dApp will retain followers indefinitely. It causes all active governance participants to stop to think about their Followee selections. Also, if neuron owners stop confirming their selections for any reason (e.g. they pass away or they lose interest in ICP governance), then their voting power will no longer be permanently assigned to a publicly known neuron. This helps ensure that public known neurons are always working to attract and retain followers.

All neurons were configured by default to follow ICA (neuron 28) for All Topics when the neuron was created. In many cases, this was not a conscious choice by the neuron owner. It has resulted in many neurons that are not casting votes on Governance motion proposals. This was a huge problem when only 6% of total voting power was casting votes on governance proposals. Now that proposal weights have been implemented, participation is up to 45% of total voting power. This is a significant advance in the decentralization effort and is a direct result of ICP tokenomics being tweaked to incentivize governance participation. These tweaks worked by enabling neurons that are voting on governance proposals to receive higher rewards while neurons that are not voting on governance proposals are receiving lower voting rewards. Yet, the incentives are insufficient. A whopping 55% of total voting power is not voting on governance proposals and the most likely way to get them to start participating is to double down on the previous tokenomics tweak by removing default following for All Topics if the neuron owner does not actively confirm their Followee selections. Neurons cannot receive voting rewards unless they vote and at this stage of ICP and NNS evolution there is no good reason why we should accept that voting rewards are being allocated purely based on default neuron configurations. We can and should expect a minimum standard of active participation by periodically and intentionally choosing to confirm Followee selections.

## Pros

- Reduces the probability that someone will produce spam proposals for personal financial gain.
- Increases decentralization by increasing the total percentage of votes that are cast on governance proposals.
- Establishes a minimum standard for active participation in governance in the form of easy, periodic confirmation of Followee selections; ensures ICP tokenomics is rewarding active participants.

## Cons

- This proposal would take time for Dfinity to place on their roadmap and implement, but it does provide time to communicate the change effectively to the IC community.
- Over half of the voting power in the NNS is not currently voting on governance proposals, which implies there are likely a lot of neuron owners who will stop receiving voting rewards if they do not confirm their Followee selection. There could be a lot of people who get upset with this change. 
- The community response to this concern can be provided in simple terms: 1) staking entitles neuron owners to vote, 2) voting entitles neuron owners to voting rewards, 3) voting can occur manually or by liquid democracy through Followee designation, 4) all neuron owners are personally responsible for making sure their neuron is voting if they want voting rewards. These principles have not changed and will not be changed with this proposal. Basically, all neuron owners are encouraged and empowered to remain active participants and configure their neurons so they can earn maximum voting rewards.

## Alternatives Considered

This proposal is not a complete solution to the proposal spam problem. It removes the incentive that is based on economic gain, but there are other causes of spam including advertisement and announcements.. However, this proposal removes the root cause of one of the strongest incentives for spam proposals while also advancing the decentralization effort. If this proposal is implemented, then it will likely increase overall voting participation on Governance proposal topics.

The [deliberation on this proposal](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/periodic-confirmation-of-neuron-followees/12109) was led by Wenzel Bartlett (@wpb) and Kyle Langham (@Kyle_Langham) and can be found on the forum. This version of the proposal was the result of initial community feedback on [our initial idea](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/reset-followees-for-the-all-topics-except-governance-category/11922).

This proposal is not intended to be binding for Dfinity to implement exactly as written. If it is approved, then the proposal would need to be implemented by Dfinity and we want them to have flexibility to shape the basic concepts in a way that makes it efficient, safe, and robust to implement programmatically. [One such idea](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/how-to-fix-the-spam-proposals-that-nns-is-currently-encountering/12248) was presented on the forum by a community member named @ysyms in which he suggested there could be an annual Followee reset day that is well advertised and known within the community. This is an example of an acceptable alternative. Our objective is to ensure that neuron owners intentionally and periodically confirm or select their Followees by using NNS governance tokenomics in a way that incentivizes participation.

#### How to prevent motion of the proposal from being attacked by malicious content (advertising bloody erotic link and induced computer virus, etc.)

I think this is very simple. You only need to develop a review rule through a motion proposal, and then specify a reviewer to review the proposal in accordance with the review rules.

#### 如何防止动议提案遭到恶意内容攻击（广告血腥色情恶意链接和诱导性的计算机病毒等）

我认为这非常简单，只需要通过动议提案来制定一个审查规则，然后指定一个审查器按照审查规则对提案进行审核即可。

The duration of the "test" proposal depends on the balance of the proposal account and whether the award bug is fixed. I have never sent any ICP to this account

## I would like to explain more about [optional legal reviewer](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/how-to-review-the-content-of-the-proposal-under-the-premise-of-decentralization/12294):

#### 1. Why it can enable decentralized content moderation

1. it is only built on the front end
2. It allows appeals
3. It does not force everyone to enable
4. Its censorship rules are set by the NNS

Since NNS has not encountered such attacks at present, I think how to solve the oligarch list and how to improve proposal participation is more important. Otherwise, NNS simply cannot formulate decentralized censorship rules.

Preventing most spam proposals only requires solving the reward problem and offensive proposals，No need to increase governance complexity.

If you think the proposal must be discussed in the forum, please write it in the review rules
If you think that the proposal cannot contain XX content, or follow the link to XX address, please write it in the review rules

Beyond that, are there any proposals that need to be blocked?



#### [Periodic Confirmation of Neuron Followees](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/55651) can fix reward bug

But it cannot be implemented immediately, it needs to wait for development. And after the development is completed, you need to wait 6 months to see the effect, if it is passed, it is also necessary to immediately reset the current follower state to solve the current problems that need to be solved immediately.

#### 10 ICP rejection costs do not fix anything.

1. Two Motion Proposals a Day to Double Your Earnings，If someone stakes more than 60,000 ICP, there is still an incentive to initiate spam proposals

2. Although the NNS has not encountered any offensive proposals at the moment, 10 ICPs are unable to block any malicious proposals

the rejection cost of 10 ICPs not only fails to solve any problems, but also increases the risk of NNS centralization

# Crowdfunding for spam proposal fees in the coming 30 days

Crowdfunding target: 600 ICP

Crowdfunding time: 7 days (before May 1)

Crowdfunding address: [2442ef90b5ea44e35defe4b16c0bf7054810cd1488cdb4da3095749505ac2e8c](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/account/2442ef90b5ea44e35defe4b16c0bf7054810cd1488cdbac2095748)

## Crowdfunding rules: If the crowdfunding address receives more than 600 ICP within seven days, it means the crowdfunding is successful, otherwise it means the crowdfunding fails

#### If the crowdfunding successful

1. I will be sending out two spam proposals per day for the next  30 days.

2. During this period, all stakers" daily returns will be doubled (based on historical data).

3. Prove that increasing the cost of proposal rejection is ineffective

#### If the crowdfunding fails

1. Prove that increasing the cost of proposal rejection is effective

2. I will refund all ICP of the crowdfunding account

3. Wait  deployment of [Periodic Confirmation of Neuron Followees](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/55651)

4. During the waiting process ([estimated for more than 3 months](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/proposal-discuss-posts/12338/2?u=ysyms)), the income of all 8 year stakers will be reduced to 0.059% per day.

#### Crowdfunding Help

According to historical data, two spam proposals per day will double the daily revenue. If you want to participate in this crowdfunding, You can send a portion of your revenue from spam proposals to a crowdfunding account

According to historical data, my suggestion is:

    [Less than 10% of daily stake income] * [30 days]

## The crowdfunding of 600 ICP spam proposals was completed in less than 24 hours, which is enough to show that the proposal rejection cost of 10ICP has no effect on the reward problem at all.

[Periodic Confirmation of Neuron Followees](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/55651) Proposal executed.

But it needs to wait for development . We need to solve the current problems that need to be solved immediately by Reset now Followers for the All Topics Category. I will later issue a formal proposal for Reset now Followers for the All Topics Category as a supplement to the [Periodic Confirmation of Neuron Followees](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/55651) proposal and Do they not conflict.

#### If the later "Reset All Topic Neuron Followers" proposal passes, the voting status of the motion proposal and other proposals will become balanced again, and stakers will not need any junk proposals to increase their earnings. Everyone wins, and 55% of the silent neurons immediately lose all their gains. ####

----

they are not perfect

I hope the community can reach consensus on the following issues in the future

1. Should 55% of silent neurons benefit?
2. Whether neurons should be allowed to abstain from voting on proposals without losing revenue.

I have not decided whether neurons should be allowed to abstain from voting on proposals. But currently I have to vote "yes" or "no" for every proposal, in fact I do not know what most network governance proposals and exchange rate proposals do. It requires that I have to trust some third party or I will lose my earnings. Those who are reluctant to manually vote for motion proposals are also forced to randomly select from a list of known neurons, which is bad. I am not against people following a certain neuron to vote, nor am I against people setting up followers and treating NNS as a DEFI project. I am just against people having to vote "yes" or "no" on every proposal because of the gain, thus being forced to choose within a list of known neurons. There are only 5 known neurons, and the user, when making a random selection, gives the known neurons powers that should not belong to them. This is very disruptive to governance.

Do not expect the known neurons after ICs reconfigure the internet to be happy to share the power they acquire by random selection by users, it is just a dream. Unless we have no intention of refactoring the Internet at all.

Maybe allowing abstention is a good attempt, but it has many uncertainties and requires more thought from the community.

## 不到24小时便完成了600个ICP的垃圾提案的众筹，这足以说明10ICP的提案拒绝成本对奖励问题根本没有任何作用。

[Periodic Confirmation of Neuron Followees](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/55651)提案已经执行，但它需要等待开发与部署。我们需要通过立即重置所有主题的神经元关注者来解决当前需要立刻解决的问题。我稍后会发出一个正式提案用于重置所有所有主题的神经元关注者，该提案作为[Periodic Confirmation of Neuron Followees](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/55651)提案的一个补充提案并不冲突。

#### 如果稍后的"重置所有主题神经元关注者"提案通过，动议提案和其他提案的投票状态会变得再次平衡，质押者便不需要任何垃圾提案就可以增加收益。大家都会赢，55%的静默神经元会失去所有收益。####

-----

它们并不完美

我希望以后社区能在以下问题上达成共识

1. 55%的静默神经元究竟应不应该获得收益
2. 是否应该允许神经元对提案投弃权票，但不会失去收益。

我没有决定是否应该允许神经元对提案投弃权票。但当前我必须对每个提案投"yes"或"no",事实上，我根据不知道大多数网络管理提案和汇率提案做了什么。它要求我必须信任某个第三方，否则我会失去收益。那些不愿意手动去投动议提案的人，也被迫在已知神经元列表中进行随机选择，这是很糟糕的。我不反对人们跟随某个神经元投票，我也不反对人们设置跟随者后把NNS当一个DEFI项目。我只是反对人们因为收益而必须对每个提案进行投出“yes”或“no”，从而被迫在已知神经元列表内进行选择。而已知神经元只有5个，用户在进行随机选择时会赋予已知神经元本来不应该属于它们的权力。这对治理有很大的破坏性。

不要指望在IC重构互联网后的已知神经元会乐于分享它们由用户的随机选择而获得的权力，这不过是一个梦。除非我们根本没有打算重构互联网。

也许允许弃权一个很好的尝试，但它有许多不确定性，需要社区更多的思考。

## objective

proposal : Instantly reset followers for all topic categories

## background

The [Periodic Confirmation of Neuron Followees](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/55651) proposal has executed, but it needs to wait for development.

This proposal serves as a supplementary proposal to regularly confirm neuron followees,It is used to solve our current problems that need to be solved immediately.

## why it matters

1. [Periodic Confirmation of Neuron Followees](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/55651) need to wait for development before implementation
2. 10icp rejection cost has no effect（[has been proved by facts](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/account/2442ef90b5ea44e35defe4b16c0bf7054810cd1488cdb4da3095749505ac2e8c)）

Maybe it should be more detailed to explain my proposal account and donation account

Before，I have already made detailed descriptions in [Frequently Initiated Motion Proposal Period Lasting Seven Days](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/52579).

----

#### Proposal account:[a367ed0ae66218194aafc9fb484dd78cc78fa28b57f4cc69b106e6aafd7403ea](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/account/a367ed0ae66218194aafc9fb484dd78cc78fa28b57f4cc69b106e6aafd7403ea)  

The proposal account is only used to send proposals to NNS before the reward problem is repaired.I have never used the ICP in this account to do anything else.It is expected that the ICP in this account will be consumed before May 1st .After consumption, I will use the ICP in the crowdfunding account to send a proposal


#### Donation account:[account:6d139f4193f3c17d654afde57869ba8e53ee4e70141e3d0cd3f1bfe80c279ce3](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/account/6d139f4193f3c17d654afde57869ba8e53ee4e70141e3d0cd3f1bfe80c279ce3)  

The donation account is my personal account, I will freely use the ICP in the account

-----

#### In addition, I have an address:[1c029648cfe980ca0805af9b6a3f75ff9adfc9b323fdde125902ca18744f67c6](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/account/1c029648cfe980ca0805af9b6a3f75ff9adfc9b323fdde125902ca18744f67c6)  

This account is an account generated by Keysmith, which is used to make neurons that initiate proposals. Similarly, I did not use the ICP in this account to do anything else

也许我应该更详细的解释一下我的提案账户和捐赠账户

实际上我早已在[Frequently initiated motion proposal period lasting seven days. 双语](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/52579)做出过详细说明:  

### 提案账户:[a367ed0ae66218194aafc9fb484dd78cc78fa28b57f4cc69b106e6aafd7403ea](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/account/a367ed0ae66218194aafc9fb484dd78cc78fa28b57f4cc69b106e6aafd7403ea)  

对于提案账户,该账户用与在奖励问题得到修复前向NNS发起提案从而增加所有人的收益。我没有使用该账户内的ICP用于其他任何事。预计将在5月1日之前此帐户中的ICP会被使用完毕。 之后，我将在众筹帐户中使用ICP发送建议

#### 捐赠账户:[6d139f4193f3c17d654afde57869ba8e53ee4e70141e3d0cd3f1bfe80c279ce3](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/account/6d139f4193f3c17d654afde57869ba8e53ee4e70141e3d0cd3f1bfe80c279ce3)    

对于捐赠账户，我会自由使用该账户内的ICP

除此之外，我还有一个地址:[1c029648cfe980ca0805af9b6a3f75ff9adfc9b323fdde125902ca18744f67c6](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/account/1c029648cfe980ca0805af9b6a3f75ff9adfc9b323fdde125902ca18744f67c6) 该账户是使用keysmith生成的账户，用于制作发起提案的神经元。同样的，我没有使用该账户内的ICP做任何其他的事

ICDEVS [Twitter stated](https://twitter.com/ICDevs_org/status/1516202510976966658?s=20&t=DlKtk2gfxlc-N-lkFTr7gg) that they opposed the "increase proposal and refusal cost" proposal, but due to the voting of ICMN, it caused nearly 2%of the error votes, hahaha well, we forgive him. This is just a small mistake that is sufficient to determine the results.🤣

2. First of all, the [#56592](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/56592) proposal and [#56591](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/56591) proposal are the spam motion proposal disguised in the subnet upgrade proposal. I hope everyone should not miss the voting for them.

 Cycledao vote "yes" for the camouflage proposal. I don’t know why. My guess is CycleDao mistakenly believes that this is a subnet upgrade proposal and did not check the content of the case.
 
 Hahaha, do you know, in China, if government personnel have neglected their duties and abuse of power, they are also sentenced to sentence. Among the most advanced DAO in the world, some people hold 7% power  and vote with their feet.

## 来一点web3笑话

1. ICdevs[在推特中表示](https://twitter.com/ICDevs_org/status/1516202510976966658?s=20&t=DlKtk2gfxlc-N-lkFTr7gg)：他们反对"增加提案拒绝成本"提案，但由于跟随ICMN投票造成了接近2%的错误选票，哈哈哈好吧我们原谅他。这不过是一个足以决定结果的小失误。🤣



2. 首先#56592提案和#56591提案是伪装成子网升级提案的垃圾动议提案，希望大家不要错过对它们的投票。

 cycledao对该伪装提案投出了"yes",我不知道是因为什么，我的猜测是cycledao误认为这是一个子网升级提案并且没有检查提案内容
 
 哈哈哈你们知道吗，在中国，如果政府人员玩忽职守滥用职权也是要被判刑的，在世界上最先进的DAO中，某些人拿着来自人民的7%的权力却在用脚投票。

                       The merits of this proposal are discussed at https://forum.dfinity.org/t/proposal-to-temporarily-reduce-governance-proposal-weight-to-1/12390.

Motion to temporarily revert all reward weights to 1

Objective: Eliminate the spam incentive on the NNS until a better solution can be implemented.

Proposal: Revert the weight of all governance topics to 1 until September 1st 2022 at which point the Governance will revert to 20 and Exchange Rate will revert to 0.1.

Note: if we solve it sooner we can always vote to revoke this.

Note 2: An argument can be made to vote again later to make this permanent.

Reasoning: The idea to differently weigh governance topics based on their value ignores the reality of black swans. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_swan_theory

Value is delivered by voting or delegating when it preserves or improves the IC network.

One bad XDR to Cycles proposal getting through could wreck the cycle market for decades(see the latest bug where Trillions and Trillions of cycles were produced and thankfully a white hat reported it.).

What if someone slips in a node reward proposal that gives 100M ICP to a hacker and they liquidate?

No one had any guarantees about what will happen in the future and any one of the categories could be a cause of unquantified harm to the system. We need ALL of them to be decentralized. We should have at least 10 organizations voting on XDR exchange proposals.

One could argue that we should increase the weight of those exchange rate proposals to 20x due to the fact that the only voting neurons right now are likely DFINITY and ICA. Most feel they can trust them, but what about an unforeseen bug? It is the same reason the ETH community wants clients written in more than one language by more than one organization.

We need to incentivize the diversification of all categories equally when taking into account second-order consequences and unknown volatility.

We need to benefit from volatility and randomness in this system. In fact, the fastest way to decentralization would be for the NNS to randomly decide the weights on certain days and for the DFINITY FOUNDATION and ICA to not vote. Then you would really get some interesting behavior! We are not ready for that yet, but once we have the solid bones of the system in place where we have 10+ independent organizations dedicated to each category it would be a great immune system to put in place.

Accept: To vote Yes (Accept) means you agree that all weight should be reverted to 1 until September 1st, 2022.

Reject: To vote No (Reject) means you do not agree that the changes should be made.

将所有奖励权重暂时恢复为 1 的动议

目标：消除 NNS 上的垃圾邮件激励，直到可以实施更好的解决方案。

建议：在 2022 年 9 月 1 日之前，将所有治理主题的权重恢复为 1，届时治理将恢复为 20，汇率将恢复为 0.1。

注意：如果我们早点解决它，我们总是可以投票撤销它。

注意 2：可以稍后再次投票以使其永久化。

推理：根据治理主题的“价值”对其进行不同权衡的想法忽略了黑天鹅的现实。 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_swan_theory

在维护或改进 IC 网络时，通过投票或委托传递价值。

一个糟糕的 XDR to Cycles 提案获得通过可能会破坏自行车市场数十年（请参阅最新的错误，其中产生了万亿和万亿个循环，谢天谢地，一顶白帽报告了它。）。

如果有人在向黑客提供 100M ICP 的节点奖励提案中滑倒并清算怎么办？

没有人对未来会发生什么有任何保证，任何一个类别都可能对系统造成无法量化的损害。我们需要所有这些都去中心化。我们应该至少有 10 个组织对 XDR 交换提案进行投票。

有人可能会争辩说，我们应该将这些汇率提案的权重提高到 20 倍，因为目前唯一的投票神经元可能是 DFINITY 和 ICA。大多数人觉得他们可以信任他们，但是一个无法预料的错误呢？这也是 ETH 社区希望由不止一个组织以不止一种语言编写的客户的原因。

在考虑二阶后果和未知波动性时，我们需要平等地激励所有类别的多样化。

我们需要从这个系统的波动性和随机性中受益。事实上，去中心化最快的方法是让 NNS 在某些日子随机决定权重，让 DFINITY FOUNDATION 和 ICA 不投票。然后你真的会得到一些有趣的行为！我们还没有为此做好准备，但是一旦我们拥有了系统的坚实基础，我们有 10 多个独立组织致力于每个类别，这将是一个很好的免疫系统。

接受：投赞成票（接受）意味着您同意在 2022 年 9 月 1 日之前将所有权重恢复为 1。

拒绝：投反对票（拒绝）意味着您不同意应进行更改。

Movimiento para revertir temporalmente todos los pesos de recompensa a 1

Objetivo: eliminar el incentivo del spam en el NNS hasta que se pueda implementar una mejor solución.

Propuesta: revertir el peso de todos los temas de gobernanza a 1 hasta el 1 de septiembre de 2022, momento en el que la gobernanza volverá a 20 y el tipo de cambio volverá a 0,1.

Nota: si lo solucionamos antes, siempre podemos votar para revocarlo.

Nota 2: Se puede hacer un argumento para votar nuevamente más tarde para que esto sea permanente.

Razonamiento: La idea de sopesar de manera diferente los temas de gobernanza en función de su valor ignora la realidad de los cisnes negros. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_swan_theory

El valor se entrega votando o delegando cuando preserva o mejora la red de IC.

Una mala propuesta de XDR a Cycles podría arruinar el mercado de bicicletas durante décadas (vea el último error donde se produjeron billones y billones de bicicletas y, afortunadamente, un sombrero blanco lo informó).

¿Qué sucede si alguien desliza una propuesta de recompensa de nodo que otorga 100 millones de ICP a un pirata informático y liquida?

Nadie tenía garantías sobre lo que sucederá en el futuro y cualquiera de las categorías podría ser la causa de un daño no cuantificado al sistema. Necesitamos que TODOS estén descentralizados. Deberíamos tener al menos 10 organizaciones votando sobre propuestas de intercambio XDR.

Se podría argumentar que deberíamos aumentar el peso de esas propuestas de tipo de cambio a 20x debido al hecho de que las únicas neuronas con derecho a voto en este momento probablemente sean DFINITY e ICA. La mayoría siente que puede confiar en ellos, pero ¿qué pasa con un error imprevisto? Es la misma razón por la que la comunidad ETH quiere clientes escritos en más de un idioma por más de una organización.

Necesitamos incentivar la diversificación de todas las categorías por igual teniendo en cuenta las consecuencias de segundo orden y la volatilidad desconocida.

Necesitamos beneficiarnos de la volatilidad y la aleatoriedad en este sistema. De hecho, la forma más rápida de descentralización sería que la NNS decidiera aleatoriamente los pesos en ciertos días y que la FUNDACIÓN DFINITY y la ICA no votaran. ¡Entonces realmente obtendrías un comportamiento interesante! Todavía no estamos listos para eso, pero una vez que tengamos los huesos sólidos del sistema en su lugar donde tengamos más de 10 organizaciones independientes dedicadas a cada categoría, sería un gran sistema inmunológico para implementar.

Aceptar: Votar Sí (Aceptar) significa que acepta que todo el peso se revierta a 1 hasta el 1 de septiembre de 2022.

Rechazar: Votar No (Rechazar) significa que no está de acuerdo con que se realicen los cambios.

## 4月27日的web3笑话

[用于解决垃圾提案问题的提案](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/56801)的得票率比[垃圾提案]((https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/56767)更低

![screenshot](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FRTJvPsagAAPpp6?format=jpg&name=900x900)

          

I am sorry today"s joke is too much, I did not mean to laugh at the proposer. This example is a good example of how bad it is to use thresholds to avoid junk proposals. It will only privilege certain people and will not solve any real problems  

Compare [proposal #56798](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/56801) and [proposal #56801](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/56801)

----

#### Quoted from [proposal #56798](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/56798) : Proposal: Revert the weight of all governance topics to 1 until September 1st 2022 at which point the Governance will revert to 20 and Exchange Rate will revert to 0.1.

Leaving aside whether to reset the weights for now, I wonder if the proposer knows that the current [exchange rate proposal weight is 0.01 instead of 0.1](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/34485), I can forgive the proposer"s mistake. However, since cycledao currently votes with icdevs, this results in 8.5% of the voting power voting in favor of a proposal with a data error of more than ten times.
I am very worried that you will issue an additional 1 billion ICP for node machine rewards in the future.

I"ve had enough of you guys continuing to sabotage the NNS.
cycledao was deceived a few days ago by a proposal disguised as a subnet upgrade yes，Now voted yes for a proposal with ten times the data error.
Stop doing stupid things with 8.5% voting power.

If possible, cycledao should be removed from the list of known neurons immediately, and their followers cleared



-----

很抱歉也许今天的笑话有些过分，我没有嘲笑提案者的意思，我只是希望一些人能明白使用阈值来避免垃圾提案的方案是很糟糕的。它只会给某些人特权，不会解决任何实际问题  

对比 [#56798提案](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/56801) 和 [#56801提案](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/56798)



-----

#### 引用 [#56798提案](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/56798): Proposal: Revert the weight of all governance topics to 1 until September 1st 2022 at which point the Governance will revert to 20 and Exchange Rate will revert to 0.1.

我们暂且不谈是否要重置权重，我想知道提案者是否知道当前的[汇率提案权重是0.01而不是0.1](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/34485)，我能原谅提案者的错误。但是由于目前cycledao跟随icdevs投票，这导致8.5%的投票权给一个数据误差超过十倍的提案投了赞成票。我很担心未来你们会增发10亿枚ICP用于节点机奖励。我已经受够你们继续破坏NNS了。
不要再用8.5%的投票权做愚蠢的事了，如果可以请立即删除cycledao

# Release Notes:
* Fix of a sensitive security vulnerability
  
**Note: In accordance with the Security Patch Policy and Procedure that was adopted in proposal 48792, the source code that was used to build this release will be exposed only after the fix is rolled out to all subnets.**

The community will be able to retroactively verify the binaries that were rolled out. The procedure for rebuilding the binaries and obtaining the sha256 sums of the rolled out binaries is:

git clone https://github.com/dfinity/ic.git
cd ic
git checkout b3788091fbdb8bed7e527d2df4cc5e50312f476c
./gitlab-ci/tools/docker-build-ic
This will generate the build image with the hash:

## Maybe I figured out a better way to solve the reward problem in a timely manner

Resetting all neurons that did not vote on this proposal also solves the reward problem
Resolved an issue where resetting follower proposals for all neurons would cause many to fail to set up followers in a timely manner

But I do not know if this is technically possible, I"ve posted it on the forum https://forum.dfinity.org/t/proposal-reset-follow-state-of-all-neurons-that-did-not-vote-on-this-proposal/12501。

## 也许我想到了更好的及时解决奖励问题的方法

重置所有没有对本提案投票的神经元也可以解决奖励问题。并且不会导致许多人无法及时设置跟随者而失去收益。但是我不知道这在技术上是否可行，我已经把它发在了论坛https://forum.dfinity.org/t/proposal-reset-follow-state-of-all-neurons-that-did-not-vote-on-this-proposal/12501。

                                                       # Effect

Deactivate initial following of new neurons

# Reasoning

Until now, new neurons by default follow DFINITY on non-governance topics and do not follow on governance. This proposal deactivates the described initial following setup for the following reasons:

* The current setup may increases the imbalance between following on non-governance and governance topics with every new neuron. While clearing the default for new neurons will not resolve the current imbalance, it works against _increasing_ the imbalance.
* Following should be an explicit decision of the neuron holder. This is in the same spirit as the accepted [proposal 55651](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/55651).
* While a majority of following on proposals such as exchange rate or disaster recovery is necessary for the smooth operation of the IC, the current following is overwhelming so no impact is expected in the foreseeable future.

The proposal has been announced and discussed in [the forum](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/proposal-deactivate-initial-following-for-new-neurons/12491).

# Implementation

The proposal uses the `SetDefaultFollowees` proposal action to clear the default following setup in the governance canister.

Recently, the revenue has decreased a bit. My guess is that the proportion of motion proposals has decreased due to the increase in [daily maintenance proposals](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/governance?s=25). Shall we move from two spam proposals per day to three spam proposals per day?

最近收益有些降低，我的猜测是因为[日常维护类提案](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/governance?s=25)变多从而导致动议提案的占比变少了。我们要不要将每日两个垃圾提案提升至每日三个垃圾提案？

## Wasm Verification

To build the wasm module yourself and verify its hash, run the following commands from the root of the nns-dapp repo:

git pull  # to ensure you have the latest changes.
git checkout `236f2fdb984c40b7db2afa27f6404438e9130b3a`
./scripts/docker-build
sha256sum nns-dapp.wasm
  Proposal(s) to unlock neurons controlled by the following principal IDs:

* `nglii-jxcfo-it462-vep2y-jvkcu-jl6h4-ciyyb-vm77o-rsgtx-xfmn6-yqe`
* `sm2lb-cwrld-xidx5-pso2k-omdgo-eri7e-e3dsh-cx2ua-2ddyx-23dgz-cqe`

        

Actually I want DFINITY to vote on every motion proposal. And I think it is extremely irresponsible for DFINITY to hand over IC governance to someone on the oligarchic list.

Please check [Increasing the Proposal Rejection Cost ](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/55141) for the proposal voting curve ahead of DFINITY vote. The vote on this proposal is a good indicator of the fact that the list of oligarchs (with the exception of DFINITY and ICA) controls the motion proposal.

## How to avoid the current DFINITY voting can decide the final result of the motion proposal

I do not think DFINITY as an organization with 250+ employees should simply vote no or yes on a proposal. My proposal is that DFINITY should distribute voting weights on motion proposals to all DFINITY employees in some form, average or otherwise.

实际上我希望DFINITY对每个动议提案都进行投票，并且我认为DFINITY将IC治理交给寡头列表的某些人来控制是极其不负责任的。

请检查[Increasing the Proposal Rejection Cost](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/55141)提案在DFINITY投票之前的投票曲线，该提案的投票情况很好的体现出了寡头列表(除了DFINITY与ICA)控制动议提案的事实。

## 如何避免当前DFINITY的投票可以决定动议提案的最终结果

我认为DFINITY作为一个拥有250多名员工的组织不应该对一个提案简单的投no或yes。我的建议是DFINITY应该把动议投票权重以某种形式分给DFINITY的所有员工，平均或者其他方式。

The current design of NNS is as ridiculous as Bitcoin miners must agree to Satoshi Nakamoto in order to get their profits. How can someone demand that proposals only be published after discussion in a dfinity-controlled forum? Why not build the discussion board into the nns proposal?The ICP governance mechanism should at least be able to maintain the normal operation of the network without relying on any centralized third party

当前NNS的设计就像比特币矿工想要拿到收益必须经过中本聪的同意一样可笑。某些人怎么能要求提案必须使用dfinity控制的论坛讨论后才能发布？为什么不把讨论区内置到nns的提案中？NNS必须尽快马上立刻做出改变，ICP治理机制至少应该能够在不依赖任何中心化第三方的情况下维持网络的正常运行。

Several people in the IC community have commented in the forum and on social media that Dfinity should communicate changes that affect tokenomics so more people are aware of the changes. This proposal is an attempt to formalize that suggestion in hopes that it can result in higher total voting power participation on Governance proposals (currently 47%). It is possible that Dfinity does not want to or cannot send this type of information for legal reasons, but perhaps they can do it if the community requests this action by way of governance proposal and a decentralized decision by the governing body.

## Proposal
Dfinity should send a communication to their email distribution list(s) that they believe are most likely to reach current ICP stakers. This communication should include information about tokenomics changes that have occurred since genesis, including relevant information about proposals [34485](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/34485), [55651](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/55651), and [48623](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/48623). The communication should also include a description of how ICP stakers can currently maximize voting rewards. Below is an example of a letter that would comply with this communication proposal. This letter is not required as written, but it is provided in case Dfinity wants the communication to be drafted solely by the community.  It can be edited, modified, or replaced by Dfinity as needed.

## The Letter 
Dear ICP Governance Participant,

We want you to maximize governance rewards. ICP is a governance token. Staking entitles you to vote, but voting entitles you to voting rewards. Voting rewards cannot be earned unless you vote and ICP tokenomics is intended to incentivize participation in governance. It is a mutable governance system and changes have occurred since genesis that are intended to incentivize participation. This letter was written by members of the Internet Computer community in order to communicate and educate as many NNS governance participants as possible about these changes. It was posted on the forum, deliberated by the community, and presented as an NNS proposal. The proposal specifically requests that Dfinity Foundation send this letter via email to the email distribution list(s) that they believe have the highest probability of reaching current stakers in the NNS.

A major goal of Internet Computer governance is decentralization. Significant progress has been made over the past year, but there is a lot of room for further improvement. One change that has catalyzed progress is proposal [34485](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/34485), which was deliberated and approved with overwhelming support by the governing body in late November 2021. This proposal had two objectives: 1) remove the Governance topic from the All Topics “catch all” and 2) weight proposals so Governance topics have much higher significance to voting rewards. The proposal was implemented in mid February and governance participation went up dramatically from approximately 5% in December to approximately 45% by late March. Since implementation, neurons that are voting on Governance proposals are earning significantly higher voting rewards and neurons that are not voting are earning significantly lower voting rewards. This change was designed to incentivize people to select Followees for the Governance topic, including new choices to follow public known neurons like the ICP Maximalist Network, Cycledao, and ICDevs. Everyone who stakes in the NNS can start earning voting rewards for participation in Governance topics. It only takes a few minutes to select one or more Followee for your neuron in the [NNS dApp](https://nns.ic0.app/). A great source of information for how to configure your neuron is the [internet computer wiki](https://wiki.internetcomputer.org/).

A more recently approved change is proposal [55651](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/55651). It specifically recommends confirmation of Followee selections every 6 months and automatic reset of Followee selections if they are not confirmed. Removal of Followees will cause the neuron to stop voting automatically, and therefore, stop earning voting rewards. The purpose of this change is to ensure that neuron owners are making active decisions on who they want for their Followees and also ensures that the Followee cannot have permanent voting power from the follower if the neuron owner is inactive. The goal of this proposal is to increase governance participation by incentivizing inactive neuron owners to actively select a Followee for the Governance topic.

Finally, proposal [48623](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/48623) is intended to change how maturity is handled by the NNS governance canister in order to avoid problems with incurring a tax burden and to enable compounding maturity with the least manual effort. This was the most controversial of the proposals that have changed tokenomics and you are encouraged to read the proposal in detail for more information.

Everyone who is staking ICP should know that the governance system is mutable. It can and will change over time in order to incentivize participation. Even with these changes, the amount of work it takes to actively participate is minimal. You just need to remain aware of changes and to spend time deciding what neuron to follow to help you maximize your voting rewards. At this time, the easiest way to maximize voting rewards is to configure your neuron with a Followee for the Governance topic and for the All Topics Except Governance “catch all” category. Soon you will also need to confirm your Followees periodically, but this should be a very simple task 2 times per year in the NNS dApp.

## Action Requested
If you believe that Dfinity should send this type of email communication in an attempt to reach current NNS stakers who are not aware of the tokenomics changes since genesis, then please vote Yes.  If you believe Dfinity should not send this type of communication, then please vote No.

## Proposal Author
Wenzel Bartlett (Forum: [@wpb](https://forum.dfinity.org/u/wpb); Twitter: [@BartlettWenzel](https://twitter.com/BartlettWenzel)).  This proposal was [deliberated on the forum](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/dfinity-communication-regarding-tokenomics-changes/12511?u=wpb) for 10 days and modified slightly to reflect community comments.
                                                          Update subnet tdb26-jop6k-aogll-7ltgs-eruif-6kk7m-qpktf-gdiqx-mxtrf-vb5e6-eqe to replica version dcb2d23dfcd9de200f235110e618713cc884cb19

Motivation: Upgrade the subnet 0 (tdb26) to rc--2022-04-12_18-31
          

Now! My [16392997059792243989](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/neuron/16392997059792243989) neuron are automatically downvoting all proposals (including exchange rate proposals).  

Although I am not a developer, but maybe I have to thank this bad NNS for letting me learn c++.  There are still some issues with the voting program, I will make it public in a few days. It takes less than 100 lines of code，I guess it could get some people to forgo the reward for boosting people who voted manually

 现在，我的 [16392997059792243989]神经元正在自动对所有提案投反对票（包括汇率提案）程序还有些问题。过几天我会公开它，我想它可以让某些人放弃提升手动投票的人的奖励。

Supplement on the voting program  

## How ordinary users use the automatic rejection program  

Since it will reject all types of proposals, users only need to follow [16392997059792243989](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/neuron/16392997059792243989) neurons in a certain type of proposal  

Tip: 16392997059792243989 will not reject the proposal sent by itself, because after a neuron sends  proposal, it will automatically vote in favor of the sent proposal  

## How to avoid 16392997059792243989 neurons missing votes due to programming errors  

16392997059792243989 neurons will follow dfinity to vote on all proposals .  
Since dfinity does not vote immediately, this neuron will vote against if the program is running normally, and follow DFINITY to vote if the program stops allowing it. so，It wont affect earnings in any way  

-------------------------


关于投票程序的补充：

## 普通用户如何使用自动拒绝程序

由于它会拒绝所有类型的提案，所以用户只需要在某个类型提案中跟随[16392997059792243989](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/neuron/16392997059792243989)神经元即可

提示：16392997059792243989不会拒绝自己所发出的提案，因为在一个神经元在发出提案后，会自动对发出的提案投赞成票

## 如何避免由于程序错误导致16392997059792243989神经元错过投票

16392997059792243989神经元会在所有提案中跟随dfinity投票。
由于dfinity不会立即投票，所以如果程序正常运行那么此神经元会投反对票，如果程序停止允许，那么此神经元会跟随DFINITY投票。无论如何都不会影响收益

## How to do a spam proposal attack on NNS without using $340,000?  

Consider the Mario 64 incident. In fact, it is only necessary to deploy all kinds of illegal software on the IC and make public, and the foundation or node operator will be forced to initiate a proposal.  

This seems to be a lot cheaper than 10 ICP.

## 如何不使用340000美金对NNS进行垃圾提案攻击？  

参考一下马里奥64事件，实际上只需要在IC上部署各类违法软件并公开，基金会或者节点运营商就要被迫发起提案。  

这似乎要比10个ICP要便宜的多。

I am still very bullish on ICP, but I am concerned about the decentralization of ICP. web3 deprives many governments of minting power and jurisdiction. I do not know how DFINITY will make a trade-off between compliance and centralization in the future. I think ICP should break away from DFINITY as soon as possible. The ICP should connect directly with developers, not through a centralized organization. I heard that there are not enough people to develop the front end of NNS? Is there a possibility to motivate more developers to contribute to IC by issuing ICP by nns?

I just pledged 1000 ICP: [16253471520202275067](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/neuron/16253471520202275067), to be honest, I am more concerned about whether I get the corresponding governance power than 20% annualized income  

What I want to ask DFINITY is:  

1. Is the boundary node part of the IC?
2. Why can border nodes bypass NNS for content censorship on IC?  
3. Why does the[ "Code of Conduct"]((https://forum.dfinity.org/t/boundary-nodes-ic0-app-code-of-conduct/12926)  ) not require NNS consent?
4. Does the we stake ICP really have the governance right of the IC?  
5. Does the we stake ICP really have the governance right of the IC?    
6. Does the we stake ICP really have the governance right of the IC?  
7. Does the we stake ICP really have the governance right of the IC?  
8. Does the we stake ICP really have the governance right of the IC?

为什么边界节点可以不经过NNS的同意就对IC进行内容审查？

我刚刚质押了1000枚ICP: [16253471520202275067](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/neuron/16253471520202275067)，说真的相比于20%的年化收益我更在意的是相应的权力。  

我想问DFINITY的是:  

1.边界节点究竟是不是IC的一部分？  
2、为什么边界节点可以绕过NNS对IC进行内容审查？
3、为什么《行为准则》不需要NNS同意？
4、我们质押ICP真的有IC的治理权吗？
5、我们质押ICP真的有IC的治理权吗？
6、我们质押ICP真的拥有IC的治理权吗？
7、我们质押ICP真的有IC的治理权吗？
8、我们质押ICP真的有IC的治理权吗？

I think the reason most people are reluctant to participate in governance is that the NNS front-end is too slow and cumbersome: it takes at least 1 minute and 16 seconds to vote on a proposal without looking at the content of the proposal.

actual data:

Open nns.ic0.app: 14.96 seconds
Login to NNS with II: 30.03 seconds
Redirect to voting interface: 6.39 seconds
Open proposal content: 7.28 seconds
Review proposal content: 0 seconds
Vote on proposal: 18.08 seconds

Total 76.74 seconds

我认为大多数人不愿意参与治理的原因是NNS前端过于缓慢与繁琐：即使不查看提案内容，对提案投票也至少需要用时1分16秒。

实测数据:

打开nns.ic0.app:用时14.96秒
使用II登录NNS：用时30.03秒
重定向至投票界面：用时6.39秒
打开提案内容:用时7.28秒
审阅提案内容:0秒
对提案投票:用时18.08秒

总计76.74秒

Due to the decline in the participation of the motion proposal, the income of active neurons for 8 years can be increased to about 0.1475% per day. However, this requires more motions to increase the weight of motion proposals.

由于动议提案参与度下降，活跃8年神经元的收益大概能够提升到每日0.1475%左右。不过这需要更多的动议来提升动议提案的权重占比。

## Wasm Verification

To build the wasm module yourself and verify its hash, run the following commands from the root of the nns-dapp repo:

git pull  # to ensure you have the latest changes.
git checkout `4a63f25d540ccac94968dc7d29cc70b60ecd5a9b`
./scripts/docker-build
sha256sum nns-dapp.wasm
  # Replace a node in subnet mpubz.

- Step 1 (this proposal): Add nodes [ph4ve-y662d-daszt-sx45z-m4ws2-vcmar-rubhr-w3c5b-o4auc-z7vzh-yqe]
- Step 2 (upcoming proposal): Remove nodes [z7o7u-zllh6-vmoem-uiqxg-c2e5o-nxgtg-4qrig-bsoit-7gpv5-viexb-6ae]

If IC is really a public blockchain, then the control of IC should really belong to all the stakers of NNS, not DFINITY not Dominic, let alone the Swiss government or the US government.  

Humans have been unable to leave the Internet. If IC really reconstructs the Internet, then what IC reconstructs is not only the Internet, but the entire human society. The governance system of IC needs to make the people of the world agree with the legitimacy of the governance of IC by stakers.  

In my opinion, IC gives us the opportunity to reconstruct the social system on the chain.  

We need to build a political system that belongs to the IC  

We need to create a legal system that belongs to the IC  

We need to build an education system that belongs to IC  

...  

Decentralization is the weapon, and a better world is the weapon.  

I want to call this new world the metaverse.

## NNS代表着IC的最高权力 -1

如果IC真的是一条公共区块链，那么IC的控制权应该真正属于NNS的所有stakers，而不是DFINITY而不是Dominic，更不应该是瑞士政府或者美国政府.  

人类已经无法离开互联网，如果IC真的重构了互联网，那么IC所重构的不仅是互联网，而是整个人类社会。IC的治理系统需要让世界人民认同stakers对IC的治理合法性。  

在我看来，IC给了我们在链上重构社会制度的机会。  

我们需要建立属于IC的政治制度  

我们需要建立属于IC的法律制度  

我们需要建立属于IC的教育制度  

...  

去中心化便是武器，一个更美好的世界便是武器。  

我想把这个新世界称之为元宇宙。

I agree that decentralization should not go ahead of technology, I know no one knows how to design a perfect DAO, but for the current NNS, it should at least treat each staker fairly  

Do you think it is fair to every staker to put certain neurons on the oligopoly list?  

Do you think it is fair for every staker to have the oligarchs review the list of oligarchs?  

Do you think it is fair to the other oligarchs to sort the list of oligarchs in order of joining?  

Do you think it is fair for every staker to require all stakers to go to a forum controlled by dfinity before they can initiate a proposal?  

Do you think it is fair to every staker to add a "Join Community Fund" button to the NNS front end that has not yet been explained in detail?  

Do you think it is fair to other stakers to add a  [#59167 proposal](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/59167) to NNS that most people ca not vote for? I have been told that neurons can vote on all proposals.  

Do you think it is reasonable to base the political power of IC users and the security of financial assets on trust in a few development organizations? Do not say it is the IC community trust in dfinity, Kim Jong-uns approval rate in North Korea is 100%.  
......  
How do you get a system that could be used by billions of people in the future to acknowledge the NNS legitimate control over it?  
It is not possible to rely on an on-chain governance system that is not as smart as the North Korean government.

## NNS代表着IC的最高权力

我同意去中心化不应该走在技术前面，我知道没有人知道应该如何设计一个完美的DAO，但是对当前的NNS，它至少要公平的对待每个staker应有的权力  

你觉得把某些神经元放在寡头列表上对每个staker公平吗？  

你觉得让寡头来审查寡头列表对每个staker公平吗？  

你觉得寡头列表按照加入顺序排序对其他寡头公平吗？  

你觉得要求所有staker必须去dfinity控制的论坛讨论后才可以发起提案对每个staker公平吗？  

你觉得在NNS前端添加一个至今仍未给出详细解释的“加入社区基金”按钮对每个staker公平吗？  

你觉得添加一种大多数人无法投票的 [#59167提案](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/59167)对其他staker公平吗？我一直被告知神经元可以对所有提案投票。  

你觉得让IC用户的政治权力与金融资产的安全性都建立在对少数开发组织的信任之上是合理的吗？不要说什么那是IC社区对dfinity的信任，金正恩在朝鲜的支持率为100%。  

.......  

你如何让一个未来可能有数十亿人使用的系统承认NNS对其的合法控制？  

仅依靠一个不如朝鲜政府聪明的链上治理系统是做不到的。

I will consider increasing the number of spam proposals in June, the data below is for reference.  
  
Take May 18-May 19 as an example  
  
There are 16 network maintenance proposals with a weight of 16  
There are 2 motion proposals with a weight of 40  
The exchange rate proposal weight is 1.44  
  
The weight ratio of the two motion proposals on the day is 40/57.44=69.63%  
  
If there are 3 motion proposals on the day, the weight will be 77.47%  
If there are 4 motion proposals on that day, the weight will be 82.10%  
If there are 5 motion proposals on the day, the weight ratio is 85.14%  
If there are 6 motion proposals on that day, the weight will be 87.31%  
If there are 7 motion proposals on the day, the weight ratio is 88.92%  
If there are 8 motion proposals on the day, the weight ratio is 90.17%  
  
It can be seen that the increase in revenue brought by the motion proposal proposal is related to the number of motion proposals and the number of network maintenance proposals.  
  
Maintenance proposals are usually settled on the same day, while motions usually need to wait 4 days for settlement. I cannot predict the number of daily proposals after 4 days, so I cannot modify the number of motion proposals based on the daily number of proposals on that day.

我将在6月考虑增加垃圾提案数量，以下数据作为参考。  

以5月18日-5月19日为例  

网络维护提案为16个，权重为16  
动议提案为2个，权重为40  
汇率提案权重为1.44  
  
当日的2个动议提案的权重占比为40/57.44=69.63%  
  
如果当日有3个动议提案，那么权重占比为77.47%  
如果当日有4个动议提案，那么权重占比为82.10%  
如果当日有5个动议提案，那么权重占比为85.14%  
如果当日有6个动议提案，那么权重占比为87.31%  
如果当日有7个动议提案，那么权重占比为88.92%  
如果当日有8个动议提案，那么权重占比为90.17%  

可以看出，动议提案提案带来的收益增加与动议提案数量和网络维护提案的数量有关。  

维护提案通常在当天结算，而动议通常需要等待4天结算，我无法预知4天后的日常提案的数量，所以不可以根据当天的日常提案数量来修改动议提案的数量。

There were some errors in yesterdays proposal  
  
Maintenance proposals also take at least 4 days to settle earnings. Proposals that have been executed do not settle the proceeds immediately, but wait until the end of the voting period. The exchange rate proposal is to settle the earnings after 12 hours. Therefore, the May 18-May 19 proposal will probably not settle the income until tomorrow.  
  
But in my June proposal, I will still choose to increase the number of daily motion proposals instead of locking the weight of the motion proposals on that day. Because there will be many uncertainties by weight. In order to avoid disputes and misunderstandings, I will fix the number of proposals per day.

昨天的提案中描述有些错误  
  
维护类提案也需要至少4天才会结算收益。已执行的提案并不会立即结算收益，而是要等待投票期的结束。汇率提案是12小时后结算收益。所以5月18日-5月19日的提案大概要在明天才会结算收益。  
  
但是我在6月的提案中我依然会选择增加每天的动议提案数量，而不是锁定当日的动议提案权重。因为按权重会有许多不确定因素。为了避免纠纷与误解，所以我会固定每天的提案数量。

It is a pain to vote on proposals with such a slow NNS, and since June may increase the number of junk proposals, I will do a procedure to automatically vote on open state proposals. This eliminates the need to log in to NNS to manually vote on daily spam proposals.  
  
It only works for neurons linked to dfx, if you only have neurons in NNS, then you can use dfx with quill to create a neuron with a balance of 1icp, then set up a follow to it in the NNS frontend.  
  
I deployed an app on IC: [ysyms.page.xyz](https://v4vsh-gaaaa-aaaai-qbgoa-cai.ic0.app/)  
It is just a demo right now, I have never learned frontend, it is ugly sorry.  
  
It will should have three parts: download link and usage and source code

使用如此缓慢的NNS对提案投票是一件很痛苦的事情，由于6月份可能会增加垃圾提案的数量，所以我会做一个自动对开放状态的提案进行投票的程序。这样便不再需要登录NNS对每天的垃圾提案手动投票。

它仅适用于链接到dfx的神经元，如果仅拥有NNS中的神经元，那么您可以使用dfx与quill创建一个余额为1icp的神经元，然后在NNS前端设置对其的跟随。

我在IC上部署了一个app：[ysyms.page.xyz](https://v4vsh-gaaaa-aaaai-qbgoa-cai.ic0.app/)
它现在只是一个演示，我从没学过前端，它很丑陋抱歉。
它将包含三个部分：下载链接和使用方法和源代码

Up to now, I have been completing the agreement in the crowdfunding as scheduled. The revenue has also been maintained at a high level, but since the daily 2 junk proposals only have a weight of 40 and are easily affected by the daily maintenance proposals, this crowdfunding will provide more choices. In addition, I will charge a handling fee in this crowdfunding  
  
#  Staged crowdfunding- it is up to the community to decide the number of spam proposals and how much fee I should get  
  
The new crowdfunding method will be phased.It is similar to the Dutch auction. If the crowdfunding fails in one stage, it will automatically enter the next stage. Different stages determine the number of different garbage proposals and the proportion of fees.

Crowdfunding time: 24 hours  
  
### stage 5:  
  
4 proposals per day. 30 days from June 1st.  
  
Fee rate: 42.85%

The spam proposal substantially increases the daily income of all active stakers and does not affect the security of the IC, I think I am doing something good for the active stakers.
(although some people do not think , I can understand what they are worried about.)  
   
I wonder if stakers are able to directly incentivize things that benefit them, rather than relying on DFINITY. Why does DFINITY want IC to contribute? Because DFINITY is the creator of IC, and because DFINITY has many ICP tokens, DFINITY is working for IC and more for itself. I do not like that ICP has to rely on a centralized development organization. Taking the integration of BTC as an example, I hope that NNS can provide economic incentives for people or organizations working to integrate BTC in the form of Additional issuance ICPs. This crowdfunding can be used as a reference for the future IC governance system. If I can get some handling fees in this crowdfunding, no matter the amount, at least it can prove that I am working directly for the NNS stakers. I think this is what a DAO should look like.

垃圾提案众筹----探索由NNS对个人的直接经济激励实现IC以去中心化的方式自我维护与进化  
  
截至目前，我一直如期完成众筹中的约定。收益也一直维持在较高的水平，但由于每日2个垃圾提案只有40的权重，容易受到每日维护提案的影响，本次众筹将会提供更多的选择。除此之外，我会在本次众筹中收取手续费。  
  
# 分阶段众筹 --由社区决定垃圾提案的数量以及我应该获得多少手续费  
  
新的众筹方式将会是分阶段的。它类似于荷兰式拍卖，如果在一个阶段众筹失败那么便自动进入下一个阶段，不同的阶段决定了不同的垃圾提案的数量以及手续费的占比。  
  
###  第一阶段  
  
关于垃圾提案:每日8个提案。从6月1日起，为期30天。  
  
手续费率:100%  
  
众筹目标:4800个ICP （8*10*30*（1+100%）=4800）  
  
众筹时间:96小时  
  
### 第二阶段:  
  
关于垃圾提案:每日7个提案。从6月1日起，为期30天。  
  
手续费率:85.71%    
  
众筹目标:3900个ICP （7*10*30*（1+85.71%）=3900）   
  
众筹时间:24小时  
  
### 第三阶段:  
  
关于垃圾提案:每日6个提案。从6月1日起，为期30天。  
    
手续费率:71.42%  
  
众筹目标:3,085.71个ICP （6*10*30*（1+71.42%）=3,085.71）  
  
众筹时间:24小时  
  
### 第四阶段:  
  

关于垃圾提案:每日5个提案。从6月1日起，为期30天。  
  
手续费率:57.14%  
  
众筹目标:2,357.14个ICP （5*10*30*（1+%）=2,357.14）  
  
众筹时间:24小时  
  
### 第五阶段:  
  
关于垃圾提案:每日4个提案。从6月1日起，为期30天。  
  
手续费率:42.85%  
  
众筹目标:2,357.14个ICP （4*10*30*（1+42.85%）=1,714.28）   
  
众筹时间:24小时  

## 第六阶段:  
  
关于垃圾提案:每日3个提案。从6月1日起，为期30天。  
  
手续费率:28.57%  
  
众筹目标:1,157.14个ICP （3*10*30*（1+28.67%）=1,157.14）   
  
众筹时间:12小时  
  
## 第七阶段:  
  
每日2个提案。从6月1日起，为期30天。  
  
手续费率:14.25%  
  
众筹目标:685.71个ICP （2*10*30*（1+14.28%）=685.71）   
  
众筹时间:12小时  
  

垃圾提案大幅增加了所有活跃stakers的每日收入并且不会影响IC的安全性，我认为我做了对活跃stakers有利的事（虽然有些人不这么认为，我可以理解他们在担忧什么）。  
  
我想知道stakers是否能够对利于自身的事做出直接激励，而不是依赖DFINITY。DFINITY为什么要IC做出贡献？因为DFINITY是IC创造者，更是因为DFINITY有着许多的ICP token，DFINITY正在为IC工作更是在为自己工作。我不喜欢ICP必须依赖集中式的开发组织，以集成BTC为例，我希希望NNS能够对为集成BTC而工作的人或组织以增发ICP的形式做出经济激励。本此众筹可以作为未来IC治理系统的参考，如果在本次众筹中我可以一些手续费，无论数量多少，至少可以证明，我正在直接为NNS的stakers工作。我认为这才DAO该有的样子。


  

### stage 1 crowdfunding
  
About Junk Proposals: 8 proposals per day. 30 days from June 1st.
  
Fee rate: 100%
  
Crowdfunding target: 4800 ICP (8*10*30*(1+100%)=4800)
  
Crowdfunding time: 96 hours (if the crowdfunding target is not reached within 96 hours, it will automatically enter the next stage of crowdfunding)  
  
Crowdfunding address: [c2f3586087a196b1735792d53411421d0e49293283709e017b9c11ce94f1aeef](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/account/c2f3586087a196b1735792d53411421d0e4929c  

## Refund Policy  
  
1. If the crowdfunding fails at a certain stage, the ICP obtained from the crowdfunding at that stage will automatically enter the next stage. For example, if 2,000 ICPs were crowdfunded in stage 1 and the crowdfunding target of stage 1 was not reached, then these 2,000 ICPs will be automatically transferred to the crowdfunding address in stage 2, and crowdfunding will be started with 2,000 ICPs in stage 2.  
   

2. If the crowdfunding fails in the last stage (stage 7), I will refund the money.  
  
Since part of the last crowdfunding was suspected to be the address of the exchanges hot wallet, I cannot directly refund the original address. To solve this problem, we use the mantissa of the fractional part of the transfer amount to determine the refund method.  
  
1. If the mantissa of the decimal part is 1, it means that your account can be refunded directly to the source address. For example, if you transfer 270.001 ICP to the crowdfunding address, It means that after the failure of the seventh stage of crowdfunding, I can directly issue a refund to the address you participated in the crowdfunding.  
2. If the mantissa of the decimal part is otherwise, it means that your account cannot be directly refunded. In this case, you can DM me via Twitter [@ysyms](https://twitter.com/AI_ccp251th) and certify that the transaction was indeed sent for you, and you will be refunded.

###  第一阶段众筹  
  
关于垃圾提案:每日8个提案。从6月1日起，为期30天。  
  
手续费率:100%  
  
众筹目标:4800个ICP （8*10*30*（1+100%）=4800）  
  
众筹时间:96小时  （如96小时候未达到众筹目标，将自动进入下一阶段众筹）

众筹地址: [c2f3586087a196b1735792d53411421d0e49293283709e017b9c11ce94f1aeef](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/account/c2f3586087a196b1735792d53411421d0e49293283709e017b9c11ce94f1aeef)  

## 退款规则  

1. 如果众筹在某个阶段失败，那么该阶段众筹得到的ICP将自动进入下一个阶段。例如，在阶段一中众筹到了2000个ICP，没有达到阶段一的众筹目标，那么这2000个ICP将被自动转移到阶段二中的众筹地址，阶段二将以2000个ICP启动众筹。  
  
2. 如果在最后一个阶段（第七阶段）众筹失败，我将会退款。  
  
由于在上次众筹中的一部分疑似为交易所热钱包的地址，所以我不能直接按照原地址退款。为了解决这个问题，我们使用转账数量的小数部分的尾数来决定退款方式。  
  
1. 如果小数部分的尾数为1，那么说明您的账户可以直接退款给源地址。例如，您像众筹地址转入270.001个ICP，则表示在第七阶段众筹失败后我可以直接对您参与众筹的地址退款。  
2. 如果小数部分的尾数其他情况，那么说明您的账户不可以直接退款。对于这种情况，你可以通过推特私信我[@ysyms](https://twitter.com/AI_ccp251th)，并证明该交易确实为您发送，即可为您退款。  

                                                                                                     


1. Yesterdays address link is invalid

2. Due to the limited amount of crowdfunding, I have to change the crowdfunding to donation, sorry. But in any case, I will initiate the proposal as agreed.
3. I have returned the ICP in the [c2f3586087a196b1735792d53411421d0e49293283709e017b9c11ce94f1aeef](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/account/c2f3586087a196b1735792d53411421d0e49293283709e017b9c11ce94f1aeef).Please do not send ICP to this address, otherwise all will be returned through the source address

     # Replace a node in subnet mpubz.

- Step 1 (this proposal): Add nodes [26f5o-ffykz-3yfnn-ivgj3-3o6di-z4ly5-awcar-xejzd-evdy6-sn4xp-2ae]
- Step 2 (upcoming proposal): Remove nodes [qnuu5-uqsk6-rncgt-udx5z-24hiv-isavn-tlmaf-b7idd-soxgu-5t5bk-fae]


Motivation: Replacing an underperforming node in the subnet.       # Replace a node in subnet mpubz.

- Step 1 (proposal [61467](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/61467)): Add nodes [26f5o-ffykz-3yfnn-ivgj3-3o6di-z4ly5-awcar-xejzd-evdy6-sn4xp-2ae]
- Step 2 (this proposal): Remove nodes [qnuu5-uqsk6-rncgt-udx5z-24hiv-isavn-tlmaf-b7idd-soxgu-5t5bk-fae]


Motivation: Finalize the replacements started with proposal [61467](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/61467)    Motivation: Remove a node that had performance problems from the network in order to redeploy it.     Update subnet tdb26-jop6k-aogll-7ltgs-eruif-6kk7m-qpktf-gdiqx-mxtrf-vb5e6-eqe to replica version e7b57fc93c62d711829ee7ee8e5df47c3edfe932

Motivation: Upgrade the subnet 0 (tdb26) to rc--2022-05-15_18-31
 Update the unassigned nodes to the latest rolled-out version           # Update the GuestOS firewall rules to enable VM-based boundary nodes in production

This step will enable the integration of VM-based boundary nodes. We need to allow the existing GuestOS nodes to peer with the new boundary node VMs by updating the GuestOS firewall rules.

Here are the IPv6 prefixes that we added since the last firewall update proposal [53405](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/53405). The IPv6 prefixes in this proposal include this previous set and the IPv6 addresses for the new VMs:


```
2604:1380:4601:6200::/48
2604:1380:4641:6100::/48
2604:1380:4091:3000::/48
2604:1380:40e1:4700::/48
2604:1380:45e1:a600::/48
```

The 5 prefixes above include the 8 previously added VMs and 10 new production boundary node VMs. Each VM is executed on a dedicated machine. The change is necessary to enable the new boundary node VMs to establish connections to the replicas. Adding the /48 prefixes is also a preparation step to add more VMs at a later point in time if necessary. 
    # Replace a node in subnet 4ecnw.

- Step 1 (this proposal): Add nodes [xajwe-ixnxz-buasu-pge3d-w6sac-zlp4o-5ejoh-qovlr-n25mc-r7axf-fae]
- Step 2 (upcoming proposal): Remove nodes [67l76-v7t2i-gueaf-xdww3-23wun-hb52e-gen3j-265dv-ougko-vyxg5-wqe]


Motivation: Replace a DFINITY-owned node in the subnet to free up a local-DC node. This will allow the Node team to easier test the new HostOS deployment method, as a part of https://forum.dfinity.org/t/the-state-and-direction-of-decentralization-nodes-on-the-internet-computer/9170/68    # Replace a node in subnet jtdsg.

- Step 2 (this proposal): Remove nodes [67l76-v7t2i-gueaf-xdww3-23wun-hb52e-gen3j-265dv-ougko-vyxg5-wqe]


Motivation: Finalize the replacements started with proposal [61500](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/61500) # Replace a node in subnet jtdsg.

- Step 1 (proposal [61504](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/61504)): Add nodes [7xsze-5pjkh-qqdcr-js6wy-njui5-bdn3c-cccji-s4oix-uvsd5-mlwkw-tae]
- Step 2 (this proposal): Remove nodes [4oio7-zc6oe-pyzzr-i5yt6-kga2l-gbqkh-qasag-ngaog-i2uhm-q35em-yqe]

I do not know if the boundary node can get the users IP.Due to Service Worker, I ca not use tor to log in to NNS, nor can I use the nns frontend to initiate proposals.

hope everyone can use the IC network anonymously. Only NNS has the ability to govern anonymous IC

（oh, the list of oligarchs seems to be real-name🤣）

If we can do justice to the power that every stakers should have then I am optimistic about the transition from web2 to web3, because those who have power in web2 also have a lot of capital. But if web3 is designed to be controlled by oligarchs, then web3 will only become a battleground between oligarchs. The so-called own is only the own of the oligarch.

The governance of a web3 blockchain should not rely on the web2 forum. It is bound to my email address and mobile phone number. It has nothing to do with my ICP. It loses its anonymity and decentralization.

Only by reconstructing all this on the chain, and only by implementing a complete governance system on the chain, can we achieve true globalization in the current trend of anti-globalization

      Change BTC testnet feature status on subnet 2fq7c-slacv-26cgz-vzbx2-2jrcs-5edph-i5s2j-tck77-c3rlz-iobzx-mqe from syncing to fully enabled, which means canisters can now request the UTXOs and balances of bitcoin testnet addresses.                                                                 

The donation process is complete in phase 5, and starting tomorrow, I will increase the number of daily motion proposals to 4.  


Besides that, I wonder why my crowdfunding account received 620 ICP, but not enough to maintain the 31 day proposal fee. 

dfx will fail to initiate the proposal because the title is too short, the content is too long, etc., but the proposal fee will still be deducted normally. is this normal?Or is it an atomicity issue with NNS?

In the phase 5 donation, I incorrectly wrote the target value as the phase 4 target value. Since there are hundreds of thousands of transactions in the addresses participating in the donation, this is probably an address from an exchange and I cannot return it directly. So if you need a refund please DM me in any of the following ways

If a certain address still does not DM me after two months, I will treat excess ICP as excess income:[ysyms.icp.page]()

        As announced in the [Forum](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/the-state-and-direction-of-decentralization-nodes-on-the-internet-computer/9170/98), this proposal decreases the upper bound for node provider rewards to 100,000 ICP per month. This change is in the context of the full automation of node provider rewards. The other network economics settings remain unchanged.

### What we vote on
This motion proposes that DFINITY includes an initial token swap in the SNS milestone Carbon.
More details on the initial token swap canister design and how
it can be used in the process of converting an existing dapp on the
Internet Computer into a decentralized dapp controlled by a SNS DAO can
be found in [this forum post](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/sns-initial-token-swap/13591).

### Objective

To decentralize a dapp, developers can hand over the control over their dapp to
a community. There are of course many ways to do so. The aim of the Internet
Computer’s SNS is to allow this in a very simple way: developers can hand over
the control of their dapp to the Internet Computer that will then launch an SNS
for them with a governance system and a token ledger according to the
specification of the developers. A crucial part of launching an SNS is how the
newly created tokens are distributed and how they are staked into neurons for
the SNS’s governance ensuring proper decentralization.

**To achieve this, we propose an initial token swap
where participants can exchange ICP tokens for SNS tokens to provide
funding for a dapp and explain how this initial token swap can be
leveraged in the launch of SNSs.
As it is essential for projects that the launch of their SNS distributes
its voting power over many different neuron holders, we propose to
prioritize the work to realize such an open initial token swap and to
include it in the Carbon milestone.**

### Proposed design
To ensure that tokens can be distributed to independent parties during an SNS launch, we propose an initial token swap, which is implemented by a newly introduced swap canister.
We first explain the proposed design for the swap canister and then how this swap canister can be integrated into the flow of an SNS launch to achieve decentralization.

#### Swap Canister design
Each SNS will have a separate swap canister that only exists for the duration of the SNS’s launch.

* The swap canister is set up at start with a defined amount of SNS tokens to be distributed publicly.
* During the swap, participants can send ICP to the swap canister to contribute to the dapp’s funding.
* At the swap’s end the collected ICP are swapped for the SNS tokens: the
  swap participants get SNS tokens and the SNS gets the collected ICP. Each
  user will receive their portion of the pool of SNS tokens, pro-rated by their
  % of the overall number of ICP contributed. 
* The swap achieves that a) a market price for the SNS token is set and b) every swap participant receives SNS tokens at that price.

To ensure that the focus of this process is on distributing dapp governance
and less on speculation, all tokens will be given out in neurons.

The following parameters can be set for each initial swap.
* **Maximum amount of ICP tokens**: The maximum amount of ICP that the swap collects as funding. If this amount is achieved, the swap ends. Together with the next parameter, this determines a minimum and maximum SNS token price.
* **Minimum amount of ICP tokens**: The minimum amount of ICP that the swap needs to collect to be considered successful. Together with the first parameter, this determines a minimum and maximum SNS token price.
* **Swap deadline**: The deadline when the swap ends. As mentioned above, the swap may end before this deadline if the maximum amount of ICP tokens has been collected.
* **Minimum number of swap participants**: The minimum number of swap participants for the swap to be considered successful.
* **Minimum and maximum amount of ICP per participant**: The minimum and maximum amount of ICP that each swap participant can contribute. The minimum achieves that each participant has a minimum investment while the maximum guarantees that no principal can get too large of a share of the initial token distribution.

If a swap is successful, neurons are created for each swap participant containing the amount of staked SNS tokens as determined by the exchange rate described above. If the swap ends but is not successful, for example because not enough ICP have been collected, all collected ICP tokens are transferred back to the swap participants.

#### SNS launch
We can then use the initial token swap to launch SNSs.
The proposed design of the SNS launch aims to achieve the following goals:
* The developers handing over a dapp to an SNS community should get some voting power in the launched SNS
* A share of the initial voting power of a launched SNS, that is neurons after the launch, should be owned by independent parties and the swap should be decentralized
* A launched SNS should have some initial funding that the SNS community can use to pay contributors, pay for cycles, and pay for usage rewards
* Prior to the swap’s end, no one can transfer SNS tokens
* At any time, the dapp can be upgraded to evolve it and address bugs

To achieve these goals, we propose that an SNS launch goes through the following stages.


* **Initializing the SNS**: When developers initialize a SNS to which they want to hand over the control of their dapp, they choose a portion of tokens that are allocated to the developers, to the initial token swap, and to a treasury, which is an account that will be owned by the SNS governance canister and can be spent by the SNS community according to their needs. Possibly they can also specify a portion of tokens that are allocated to other predefined parties, for example to "airdrop" some tokens to known dapp users. The developers can also define the conditions for the swap, for example how many ICP tokens should at least and at most be collected (see details above).
  As the SNS is not yet decentralized, the swap canister is controlled by the NNS.
  There are only two ledger accounts with liquid tokens during the SNS launch, the treasury that is owned by the governance canister and preallocated tokens owned by the swap canister. To ensure that no one can transfer tokens prematurely, all initial tokens from developers or "airdrop participants"
  are locked in neurons. Moreover, to ensure that these initial neurons cannot modify the SNS before or during the swap and cannot transfer the treasury tokens, the SNS is deployed in a pre-initial-swap mode with limited functionality.
* **Dapp control handover**: Between the SNS initialization and the start of the swap, the developers hand over the control of their dapp to the SNS. As there are already initial neurons (from Step 1), the dapp can now be upgraded via SNS proposals. The initial neurons can not do other things, such as changing the SNS parameters, as the SNS governance canister is still in pre-initial-swap mode. As the developers were already controlling the dapp before the SNS initialization, they effectively do not have any additional privileges compared to the state before the SNS initialization.
* **Starting the swap**: The swap is started by an NNS proposal. This means that during the launch, the developers that originally controlled the dapp hand over the control of their dapp to the NNS that then initializes the swap for them. When voting on a NNS proposal to start a swap, the NNS neurons should consider whether the swap parameters make sense and, most importantly, whether the dapp’s control has been handed over to the SNS already (that is Step 2 was completed successfully). The NNS proposal thus also serves as a safeguard where the wisdom of the crowd can detect potentially malicious SNSs before they trick users into investing in them.
  If the NNS proposal is adopted, the swap is started by the NNS. If the NNS proposal is rejected, the SNS launch is aborted and the dapp’s control is handed back to the developers.
* **Initial swap**: When the swap starts, the swap canister holds the number of SNS tokens that were specified at initialization (see Step 1). End users can participate in the initial token swap by transferring ICP tokens to the swap canister.
* **SNS genesis**: When the swap ends, it is first established whether the swap was successful, e.g., enough ICP have been collected.
  If the swap was successful, the exchange rate is determined as explained above and all tokens will be given to the swap participants in neurons. Once all neurons are created, the SNS is under decentralized control and the governance canister is set to be fully functional.
  If the swap was not successful, the decentralization attempt failed. Thus, everything will be reverted to the state before the SNS launch, including that the dapp’s control is handed back to the developers and all collected ICP are refunded to the swap participants.

## What we vote on
This motion proposes that DFINITY includes an SNS reward scheme in the Carbon milestone.

## Summary and objective
* In order to unlock the full potential of a tokenized open governance system for a service nervous system (SNS) we require an SNS reward scheme.
* Following the SNS release strategy to deliver functionality in stages, we suggest introducing a first simple scheme for SNS rewards. The proposal covers voting rewards and usage rewards.
* To facilitate a timely delivery, we suggest leveraging the concepts and code base of the Network Nervous System (NNS) reward scheme. This has the advantage that the community is already familiar with key concepts and that we can leverage the existing code base.
* An SNS will have the flexibility to configure the reward scheme to a broad set of use cases.
* This proposal has been discussed in this [forum post](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/open-governance-canister-for-sns-design-proposal/10224/36) and a dedicated [community conversation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V8nQ053aB8&list=PLuhDt1vhGcrez-f3I0_hvbwGZHZzkZ7Ng). The forum post also contains further details and background information.

## Recap on NNS voting rewards
Within the NNS, voting rewards are paid out daily, based on an overall reward pool. The NNS reward function specifies how the reward pool evolves over time. Each neuron receives a pro-rata amount of that pool according to the voting power with which the neuron voted and in how many proposals the neuron participated.

## Proposed design for SNS rewards

**Voting rewards:**
We propose to leverage the NNS voting reward scheme and allow for flexibility to configure the scheme. In particular, we suggest that an SNS has the ability
* to influence the shape of the reward function. This includes the ability to choose between a limited/unlimited total supply and the ability to configure the development of supply over time.
* to configure the parameters determining the voting power of neurons, namely the dissolve delay bonus and the age bonus.

**Usage rewards:**
Given that the meaning of usage and the according usage rewards can vary greatly across individual SNSs we suggest a very simple set-up at start. In particular, we suggest that some tokens (reserved for usage rewards) can be held in an account owned by an SNS-controlled canister. This canister can then codify when the rewards are paid out and to whom.

## Security
If reward schemes are implemented incorrectly some participants might receive more maturity or token rewards than they deserve or other users might not get sufficient rewards. To mitigate this risk, we plan to carefully test the code and review both the design and implementation together with the security team of DFNITY.

## Alternatives considered
Alternative 1: Very simple set-up
* Voting power is allocated according to the quantity of SNS tokens. No staking and minimum looking period, no voting rewards.
* We did not pursue this alternative, as the proposed design can be configured to such a simple set-up but provides more flexibility to those who prefer other options.

Alternative 2: Even more flexible
* Allow for further flexibility in the determination of voting power and allocation.
* We chose to not add this additional implementation complexity for the first stage as the simpler feature can be delivered faster. More flexibility can be added in a next step, when it might also be clearer what additional features SNSs are looking for.

## Wasm Verification

To build the wasm module yourself and verify its hash, run the following commands from the root of the nns-dapp repo:

```
git fetch  # to ensure you have the latest changes.
git checkout `13cfe3ce005a0d39a8e03a815e34e821d6576d67`
./scripts/docker-build
sha256sum nns-dapp.wasm

1. Reduce the number of spam proposals to 2-5;  
2. Adjust the handling fee rate to a fixed 100%  
3. There are 31 days in July  
4. For the relationship between the number and weight of motion proposals, please refer to [#60976 Proposal](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/60976)  
5. Due to certain legal risks, I can guarantee that the motion proposal will be launched as promised, but I cannot guarantee that it will bring you any benefit. If you think more motion proposals are in your favor, you can participate in this donation.  
6. If the donation fails in a certain stage, it will automatically enter the next stage. If it still fails in the last stage, please send a private message to me for a refund: https://twitter.com/AI_ccp251th  
  
(Although it still has to be based on trust in me, but I think it can be solved, such as asking me to lock some ICP and release the donated ICP daily, if I get the daily released ICP but not If the proposal is initiated, then the donor can vote to take the locked ICP and stop releasing the remaining ICP)

7月份垃圾提案捐赠说明

1. 将垃圾提案数量范围缩小为2-5；  
2. 调整手续费费率为固定的100%  
3. 7月份有31天  
4. 关于动议提案的数量与权重的关系请参考 [#60976 提案](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/60976)   
5. 由于某些法律风险，我能保证如约发起动议提案，但是我不能保证它会为你带来任何收益。如果你认为更多的动议提案对你有利，便可以参与本次捐赠。  
6. 如果捐赠在某一个阶段失败则自动进入下一阶段，如果在最后一个阶段依然失败，那么请私信我进行退款:https://twitter.com/AI_ccp251th  
  
（虽然它依然要建立在对我的信任之上，但是我认为这是可以解决的，比如要求我质押一些ICP，并将捐赠的ICP每日释放，如果我拿到了每日释放的ICP但没有如约发起提案，那么捐赠者可以投票拿走质押的ICP并停止释放剩余的ICP）

## The list of oligarchs is like Satoshi Nakamoto created a mining pool, which is built into the protocol, and when people mine, a window is forced to pop up, asking if the miners want to join my mining pool. Oops, why did not Satoshi Nakamoto think of it? Maybe it is because we are too advanced.

## 寡头列表就像中本聪创建了一个矿池，它内置在协议中，当人们挖矿时，强制弹出一个窗口，询问矿工是否要加入我的矿池。 哎呀，为什么中本聪没有想到呢？ 也许是因为我们太先进了。

This release introduces protected recovery phrases, a long requested feature. Recovery phrases can now be protected, which means that the recovery phrase has to be entered again before being able to remove or change it. This is also our first community contribution by @olsemeno, @dostro and @lastmjs. Thanks a lot!

In addition to protected recovery phrases, there have also been a lot of infrastructure changes. Most notably, we have now completely moved all the tests from Haskell to Rust.

The sha256 of production asset [internet_identity_production.wasm](https://github.com/dfinity/internet-identity/releases/download/release-2022-07-05/internet_identity_production.wasm) is [3d6b6828cd3a2f404c5ae10c635d110bf7c81075c9eff07f2eacfc41fc57b3e7](https://github.com/dfinity/internet-identity/runs/7192844795?check_suite_focus=true#step:5:1).

        The NNS subnet (tdb26) currently runs at a lower block rate than all app subnets, which results in a higher latency for canisters on that subnet. This proposal proposes to increase the block rate on that subnet by decreasing the notarization delay parameter from 2000 to 1000 ms. The DKG interval is adjusted from every 100 blocks to every 200 blocks, to avoid running DKG too frequently if we increase the block rate.                 # Replace a node in subnet 3hhby.

- Step 2 (this proposal): Remove nodes [mxlae-z6xee-6fory-qsbnt-pz34n-7dyqw-yr5wx-tpnez-qsd7m-uom4e-uae]


Motivation: Finalize the replacements started with proposal [68617](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/68617)                    Update subnet shefu-t3kr5-t5q3w-mqmdq-jabyv-vyvtf-cyyey-3kmo4-toyln-emubw-4qe to replica version 91de076616c096addc0d4dced18bcc8581a9e530
 Update subnet 2fq7c-slacv-26cgz-vzbx2-2jrcs-5edph-i5s2j-tck77-c3rlz-iobzx-mqe to replica version 91de076616c096addc0d4dced18bcc8581a9e530
    This proposal changes the consensus parameters of subnet x33ed in the same way that proposal 68599 changed the parameters of tdb26: it increases the block rate by reducing the notarization delay, and increases the DKG interval length accordingly.  Set the max block payload size on subnet o3ow2 to 4MiB, which is the same as on all other application subnets. So far this subnet had no max payload size set, which means blocks can only be as large as the max ingress/xnet message size.                                                                      # Replace a node in subnet 2fq7c.

- Step 1 (proposal [68630](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/68630)): Add nodes [dxcry-2t7eb-h6cbp-d4jme-icjux-etytd-5tpxl-243ph-cgz3s-qx65z-sae]
- Step 2 (this proposal): Remove nodes [lelfu-zqgtq-lamuv-yobhu-srgs6-fmy5o-5m6ka-x5rts-i7wv7-je3sn-oqe]


Motivation: Finalize the replacements started with proposal [68630](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/68630)  # Replace nodes in subnet nl6hn.

- Step 1 (proposal [68618](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/68618)): Add nodes [uh36g-chhei-ecn54-h5noz-nobfy-qznqb-cxmsu-6l7z3-zn4nb-sh375-7ae, poffs-zghwl-dqlut-o2hnr-x2amw-hqax6-wvorb-ckl2g-wi2ea-hdkk4-fqe]
- Step 2 (this proposal): Remove nodes [ovta6-h7cop-l3ooe-w2gr6-lkubq-wosvu-tqlcm-mypqr-6qhgy-n2nat-zqe, ld3bb-debdt-phh4x-4crrl-4evtx-vokra-mxbp3-qxjiy-uwbuf-22ggv-uae]


Motivation: Finalize the replacements started with proposal [68618](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/68618)      Update subnet w4asl-4nmyj-qnr7c-6cqq4-tkwmt-o26di-iupkq-vx4kt-asbrx-jzuxh-4ae to replica version 91de076616c096addc0d4dced18bcc8581a9e530
 Update subnet pjljw-kztyl-46ud4-ofrj6-nzkhm-3n4nt-wi3jt-ypmav-ijqkt-gjf66-uae to replica version 91de076616c096addc0d4dced18bcc8581a9e530
                # Replace nodes in subnet tdb26.

- Step 1 (this proposal): Add nodes [zrl6x-yjetl-ttdnl-xnfox-5mbg5-lhqmi-nr6k5-qdrew-eog6p-napdd-qqe, ytcq7-sobyk-3qt4m-s2v3k-u6vts-u3cfw-5fcvc-3fswc-zmigs-qyv3w-pae, 72met-tfr6q-f42ni-2qll5-coi6n-4mx5v-h7jmn-h6d6a-cbuta-2evum-kqe]
- Step 2 (upcoming proposal): Remove nodes [entre-6ysld-ffytt-mzzbs-t57rn-2axmr-262fv-z4qov-tyedl-vu36w-yae, zzjyo-qffhf-7o5hc-dw5sf-7wxje-gkdoe-djf6l-uuhax-rekhf-zigth-vae, ue5ec-fqss7-su7nu-cbtut-wunlk-6rrtl-6agqa-gpxjs-iflqh-ax3kn-vqe]


Motivation: Replacing a BU1 node in accordance with https://forum.dfinity.org/t/the-state-and-direction-of-decentralization-nodes-on-the-internet-computer/9170/105  This proposal changes the consensus parameters of subnet uzr34 in the same way that proposal 68599 changed the parameters of tdb26: it increases the block rate by reducing the notarization delay, and increases the DKG interval length accordingly.       Update subnet snjp4-xlbw4-mnbog-ddwy6-6ckfd-2w5a2-eipqo-7l436-pxqkh-l6fuv-vae to replica version 91de076616c096addc0d4dced18bcc8581a9e530

   This is release [release-2022-07-11](https://github.com/dfinity/internet-identity/releases/tag/release-2022-07-11) for commit [7d866b28fd2286e34ab4f8b212c03f02fec4226e](https://github.com/dfinity/internet-identity/commit/7d866b28fd2286e34ab4f8b212c03f02fec4226e).

This release contains one notable new feature, which is the ability for dapp developers to move the front-end origin to a new domain while keeping the principals of the users stable. Additionally, a small bug related to the protected recovery phrases (introduced last week) has also been fixed.

The sha256 of production asset [internet_identity_production.wasm](https://github.com/dfinity/internet-identity/releases/download/release-2022-07-11/internet_identity_production.wasm) is [4896a0ee8a02d71639bcfbe1a4336c876075076e31ec9aec8cc401c802da8f46](https://github.com/dfinity/internet-identity/runs/7281834242?check_suite_focus=true#step:5:1).

# Release Notes:
* Fix of a sensitive security vulnerability

**Note:** In accordance with the Security Patch Policy and Procedure that was adopted in proposal [48792](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/48792), the source code that was used to build this release will be exposed only after the fix is rolled out to all subnets.

The community will be able to retroactively verify the binaries that were rolled out. The procedure for rebuilding the binaries and obtaining the sha256 sums of the rolled out binaries is:

```
git clone https://github.com/dfinity/ic.git
cd ic
git checkout 8993849de5fab76e796d67750facee55a0bf6649
./gitlab-ci/tools/docker-build-ic
```

This will generate the build image with the hash:
```
IC-OS Image
f578ba53ada8cf6d14f7d2afa553aeb41968dc015976e3085ca89f4e65d1766d  update-img.tar.gz
```
Which is the sha256sum of the update image used in this proposal.

     Elect new replica binary revision [8680de8ebefab1cd313a1db24f5218c4ce477b90](https://github.com/dfinity/ic/tree/8680de8ebefab1cd313a1db24f5218c4ce477b90)

# Release Notes:
* Use a single routing counter for all ic00 requests
* Include ECDSA payload in blocks when a replica upgrade is pending

This is a minor change on top of  `406881b17f1cbc703713e80316dd6fea003738ba`
             

## Background
* Over the last few weeks there were growing concerns within the community and the DFINITY team regarding the current spam situation.
* In particular, with respect to introducing new developers and users to the Internet Computer, spam is considered quite confusing.

## Proposal 
* As a temporary fix, DFINITY suggests to reconsider the (earlier rejected) proposal to temporarily revert voting rewards weights for governance proposals back to 1.
* Given the current situation and engineering capacity, we believe that temporarily reverting voting rewards weights for governance proposals back to 1 is the most pragmatic solution for a short-term reduction of the incentives for spam.
* Once the SNS functionality has been delivered, DFINITY will take on the task of proposing a more long-term and permanent solution to the problem.

## Analysis
* The proposed tactical fix reduces but does not completely remove the incentive to submit spam proposals.
* This is because approximately half of the total voting power is not voting on governance proposals after the reset of default following of all neurons in Q1’22.
* For further details please see the [forum post](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/way-forward-on-spam-proposal-for-tactical-fix/14275).

The syncing was paused on June 3rd due to degraded performance due to a high volume of writes to disk. Since then, improvements have been introduced to make the subnet cope with higher volume of writes, and we've tested a full Butcoin mainnet sync on a testnet.

 # Tips: Open IC0.app will jump to IC dashboard

 

 Why to Now havent the motion proposal weights been changed?

                                                                                                             Update subnet tdb26-jop6k-aogll-7ltgs-eruif-6kk7m-qpktf-gdiqx-mxtrf-vb5e6-eqe to replica version 0b2ce07fd7b4f482ec80572586ef8990ec9cd16f
 Update the unassigned nodes to the latest rolled out version                           # Replace a node in subnet qxesv.

- Step 1 (proposal [71664](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/71664)): Add nodes [kzlfn-xeqoz-zcrlc-no4r5-pfjdw-flzfm-cq7zw-bbipw-fw3u7-bsoa6-4qe]
- Step 2 (this proposal): Remove nodes [koe55-ekkzm-avp3z-ifzla-orphy-dc2m4-erepg-ja7yp-fl7yo-fkgg2-uae]


Motivation: Finalize the replacements started with proposal [71664](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/71664)     Update subnet io67a-2jmkw-zup3h-snbwi-g6a5n-rm5dn-b6png-lvdpl-nqnto-yih6l-gqe to replica version 4e51609f17da095aff7ceae413d5e69aeaa869b2

[@justmythoughts](https://forum.dfinity.org/u/justmythoughts), [@wpb](https://forum.dfinity.org/u/wpb), [@Zane](https://forum.dfinity.org/u/zane)

## Proposal
We propose that DFINITY implement proposals [55651 - Periodic Confirmation of Neuron Followees 9](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/55651) and [38985 - Enable Manual Voting throughout the Entire Voting Period 10](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/38985) before fully implementing proposal [48623 - Compounding Maturity Proposal 10](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/48623).

## Prioritizing Decentralization of the IC over Tax Optimization
A very important driver for wanting to prioritize proposals 55651 and 38985 over 48623 is that they will have a bigger impact on the decentralization of the IC. Proposal 55651 seeks to ensure that voting rewards are distributed to neurons whose owners meet a minimum standard of active participation, which is simply to confirm their Followee selections every 6 months, instead of neurons that were configured by default to follow DFINITY at genesis. Proposal 38985 seeks to allow all neurons owners to vote manually at any time during the Voting Period even if their Followee(s) has already voted. Both of these proposals are directly aligned with the ethos of active and decentralized NNS governance and the purpose of the tokenomics incentives. Proposal 48623 seeks to help neuron owners avoid incurring a tax burden. In the process of addressing this issue, the changes will also add a lot of new voting power to the NNS from ICP that is currently sitting in large genesis neurons as maturity and it will influence ICP price with the modulation function. These are not the primary objectives of NNS governance and tokenomics incentives. Hence, prioritization of proposals 55651 and 38985 over proposal 48623 seems to be more closely aligned with governance objectives at this time.

## Background
Over the past year, the NNS voting community has passed many proposals related to the NNS, including:

**Dashboard NNS Proposal Links** - (Note the % are out of those who voted, not total staked voting power)
- [38985] [Enable Manual Voting throughout the Entire Voting Period 10](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/38985) (Passed 2022-01-11 with 91% approval)
- [55651] [Periodic Confirmation of Neuron Followees 9](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/55651) (Passed 2022-04-24 with 90% approval)
- [48491] [Motion Proposal for NNS Neuron ID Indexing 1](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/48491) (Passed 2022-03-12 with 74% approval)
- [48623] [Compounding Maturity Proposal 10](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/48623) (Passed 2022-03-14 with 51% approval)

Even though Compounding Maturity Proposal was, and still is one of the most controversial and close governance proposal votes to pass the NNS (51% approval vs. 49% reject), the DFINITY foundation has chosen to [prioritize and deliver this proposal first 2](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/compounding-maturity-nns-implementation-update/14387).

Adding on, the [@jwiegley](https://forum.dfinity.org/u/jwiegley), the original DFINITY engineer who was put in charge of the [original Compounding Maturity Proposal 1](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/request-for-feedback-compounding-maturity-proposal/11011), has since left DFINITY and publicly come out against the implementation of this proposal on the developer forums.

[Compounding Maturity - NNS implementation update](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/compounding-maturity-nns-implementation-update/14387/30)
> Although I started the original discussion on this feature, I want to go on record that I think it is a very bad idea. I predict it will not benefit price, not help anyone with their taxes, and it will further complicate an already very complicated system – in ways that may introduce unknown complications that will themselves have to be mitigated later, as happened with changing voting weights. Clever ideas on top of complex systems often seem like a good idea before they are put into practice. …

## Why should I pass this as a voter, isn’t this micromanagement?
First off, no organization, team, or employee works well being micro-managed, and most NNS voters believe in the vision and capability of DFINITY to deliver on their roadmap, as they have proven the ability to do so (good job DFINITY!).

However, when a proposal driven and passed by the voters passes the NNS, there is some expectation that this proposal is eventually worked on, but there is currently no mechanism or guarantee that DFINITY will actually implement that proposal.

What voters see right now is that the Compounding Maturity proposal, which was the top priority of the head of DFINITY, is being prioritized in front of other proposals that passed earlier and with much higher approval. In fact, those other proposals have not even been given places on the roadmap.

In fact, 7 out of all 8 of [@dominicwilliams](https://forum.dfinity.org/u/dominicwilliams) replies on these forums until now have been with respect to the Compounding Maturity Proposal [Profile - dominicwilliams - Internet Computer Developer Forum](https://forum.dfinity.org/u/dominicwilliams/activity)

[Request for feedback: Compounding Maturity Proposal](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/request-for-feedback-compounding-maturity-proposal/11011/110)
> Hey everyone, this thread contains many good points and questions, and I hope to cover them. Discussions will roll on for a while. Big thanks to everyone who has taken the time to give their views so far. I want to start by addressing the tax considerations, and whether it is appropriate for the design of neuron staking to be sympathetic to them. The case of a Seed investor who thought they faced major losses There was an engineer in California, who persuaded his mum to participate in the 201…

If the implementation of proposals passed by the NNS is truly just dependent on “top down C-suite level management”, and decision making that puts their own priorities first over those of the voters, it actually shows that the NNS is not decentralized. In fact, **all this shows that we are all operating under the facade of a decentralized vote**.

This has even larger implications in the value of your ICP as a governance token - is it just worth the compute cycles from burning, or does your voting power actually matter? Can your vote actually drive DFINITY to implement and deliver any proposal, especially one that passed the NNS 6 months ago by a wide approval margin?

## What we’re asking the governing body
This will not be something that we in the community expect the voters to do often. We don’t want to push DFINITY to context switch on a whim, or to micro-manage them as stated before → that would kill innovation and their vision.

In this case, we’re asking voters in the community to push back on the internal prioritization of a highly controversial proposal, criticized by its original implementer, that barely passed the NNS, and has been dictated and driven by a single person from the very start.

We’re asking voters to publicly say that they want DFINITY to take proposals that the IC governing body has passed convincingly, and to prioritize that work in the DFINITY roadmap.

We’re asking voters to publicly push DFINITY to take the following into account when they prioritize proposals:
- The chronological order in which they were passed
- The approval percentage associated with the NNS vote
- The backwards-compatibility of the change, and the friction/pushback that it would cause within the community.

# Release Notes:
Security patch update

In accordance with the Security Patch Policy and Procedure that was adopted in proposal [48792](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/48792), the source code that was used to build this release will be exposed only after the fix is rolled out to all subnets.
The community will be able to retroactively verify the binaries that were rolled out. The procedure for rebuilding the binaries and obtaining the sha256 sums of the rolled out binaries is:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/dfinity/ic.git
cd ic
git checkout b37a94be48a5f110e71380f20aa46c36f0d6dd5f
./gitlab-ci/tools/docker-build-ic
```

This will generate the build image with the hash:

```
IC-OS Image b9dcc0c3aa415e60228473fb93ae87e0b9f8ab2faa0ee14331df0d8b02015784 update-img.tar.gz
```

The computed hash should match the hash of the image in this proposal

# Release Notes:
* Enabling remote CSP vault
 The IC’s monitoring system is being migrated to a new dedicated cluster with
upgraded versions of prometheus and grafana. The machines in this cluster have
IPv6 addresses with prefix 2a05:d01c:d9:2b00::/56. In order to monitor the
health of replica nodes they need to allow IPv6 traffic coming from this
prefix, hence this proposal to change the firewall rules.

The new cluster will improve performance and give access to new query
functionality improving the observability of the IC. The new cluster will also
be fully dedicated to monitoring mainnet and won’t monitor anything else like
testnets or other services.

After the migration is complete a new proposal will follow that will remove the
IPv6 prefix of the current monitoring system.

The ICRC-1 Fungible Token Standard is the product of the collaborative effort of the [Ledger & Tokenization working group](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/announcing-token-standard-as-topic-of-the-first-meeting-of-the-ledger-tokenization-working-group/11925/1), including members from the [DFINITY Foundation](https://dfinity.org/), [InfinitySwap](https://infinityswap.one/), [Demergent Labs](https://github.com/demergent-labs), [ICDevs](https://icdevs.org/), [Tomahawk.vc](https://www.tomahawk.vc/), [Enoki](https://enoki.ooo/), [Distrikt](https://distrikt.app), LIFTECHNOLOGY, [Internet Identity Labs](https://nfid.one/), and the [ORIGYN Foundation](https://www.origyn.com/).
This proposal describes the core features of the proposed standard, its expected evolution, and arguments for and against the standard to help you make an informed decision.

## Motivation

On the 6th of March 2021, the ICP ledger [minted the first tokens](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/transaction/9e32c54975adf84a1d98f19df41bbc34a752a899c32cc9c0000200b2c4308f85).
Since then, the DeFi ecosystem has flourished:

* The [Psychedelic Studio](https://psychedelic.ooo/) built a rich ecosystem around the [DIP20](https://github.com/Psychedelic/DIP20) token standard.
* The [ORIGYN Foundation](https://www.origyn.com/) launched their [OGY](https://www.origyn.com/ogy) token powered by the ICP ledger technology.
* [InfinitySwap](https://infinityswap.one/) developed the [IS20](https://www.blog.infinityswap.one/infinityswap-the-is20-token-standard-decentralized-and-interoperable/) token standard.
* [ToniqLabs](https://toniqlabs.com/) developed the [EXT](https://github.com/Toniq-Labs/extendable-token) token standard.

The proliferation of token standards makes it hard for smart contract and tools developers to pick the foundation to build on.
In April 2022, many interested parties joined the Ledger & Tokenization working group to agree on a standard that could serve as a basic framework for token ledgers on the Internet Computer and improve the interoperability of DeFi services.

## What does the standard imply?

ICRC-1 is a contract between organizations participating in the Ledger & Tokenization working group and the community.
If the standard is accepted, we agree to

* Provide a production-ready implementation of the standard.
* Support the standard in our existing and future products.
* Build tools to interact with standard-compliant implementations.
* Promote the standard.
* Design extensions to the standard to simplify and scale payment flows.

Accepting the ICRC-1 standard does not imply that all other standards should be considered obsolete.
Everyone is free to experiment with new designs, application interfaces, and products.

The main goal of ICRC-1 is to provide a solid common ground for interoperability.

## Arguments for the standard

* This standard builds on lessons learned from operating and extending the ICP ledger, [one of the largest token ledgers](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/transactions) in the ecosystem.
* It is possible to integrate ICRC-1 endpoints into all major token ledger implementations, including the ICP ledger and most ledgers modeled after the [ERC-20](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-20/) token standard (see the [Two-component account structure](#two-component-account-structure) subsection for more detail).
* The standard is known to have [a scalable and secure implementation](https://github.com/dfinity/ic/tree/1b2e15f17f8a2beaf28f802d675240f252585a30/rs/rosetta-api/icrc1) that will ship with the [SNS](https://medium.com/dfinity/how-the-service-nervous-system-sns-will-bring-tokenized-governance-to-on-chain-dapps-b74fb8364a5c).
* The standard has a modular design allowing future extensions without the loss of backward compatibility (see the [Modularity](#modularity) subsection).

## Comments on the arguments against this standard

The Ledger & Tokenization working group collected feedback from its members and the community. Below are the common arguments against accepting ICRC-1 as a standard and the commentary from the working group.

* **&ldquo;ICRC-1 does not provide a reasonable payment flow.&rdquo;**

  The standard is intentionally conservative and purposely avoids features that have known security flaws or can compromise the correctness or scalability of implementation with the current state of the core platform.
  Instead of cramming as much functionality as possible into a single API, the working group decided to include only the necessary and universal functionality into ICRC-1 and standardize additional payment flows as future extensions (see the [Modularity](#modularity) subsection).
  Note that the [proposed interface](#the-application-programming-interface) is powerful enough to support a payment flow based on subaccounts.
  All canisters smart contracts interacting with the ICP ledger rely on that flow.

* **&ldquo;ICRC-1 provides no benefits over alternatives.&rdquo;**

  ICRC-1 does not seek to replace existing standards but rather complement them, providing a unified interface for token transfers.
  Most token ledgers should be able to become standard-compliant without having to throw away their transaction logs.

* **&ldquo;It is too late to introduce a standard.&rdquo;**

  The core team is working on many features that can reshape DeFi on the Internet Computer.
  Some working group members think it is too early to agree on a single standard for all purposes!
  ICRC-1&rsquo;s extension mechanism allows the DeFi capabilities to grow as the platform evolves.
  See the [Modularity](#modularity) subsection for more detail.

* **&ldquo;The account addressing scheme involving subaccounts is unnecessarily complicated.&rdquo;**

  Subaccounts are a polarizing feature; however, most working group members found them valuable in practice, and most users have experience with subaccounts from traditional banking systems.
  See the [Two-component account structure](#two-component-account-structure) subsection for more detail.

## The application programming interface

Below is the entire [Candid](https://github.com/dfinity/candid) interface required by the standard.

```candid
type Timestamp = nat64; // UNIX timestamp, nanoseconds
type Subaccount = blob; // 32-byte blob
type Memo = blob;       // up to 32 bytes long

type Account = record { owner : principal; subaccount : opt Subaccount; };

type TransferArgs = record {
    from_subaccount : opt Subaccount;
    to : Account;
    amount : nat;
    fee : opt nat;
    memo : opt Memo;
    created_at_time : opt Timestamp;
};

type TransferError = variant {
    BadFee : record { expected_fee : nat };
    BadBurn : record { min_burn_amount : nat };
    InsufficientFunds : record { balance : nat };
    TooOld;
    CreatedInFuture: record { ledger_time : Timestamp };
    Duplicate : record { duplicate_of : nat };
    TemporarilyUnavailable;
    GenericError : record { error_code : nat; message : text };
};

type Value = variant { Nat : nat; Int : int; Text : text; Blob : blob; };

service : {
    icrc1_metadata : () -> (vec record { text; Value; }) query;
    icrc1_name : () -> (text) query;
    icrc1_symbol : () -> (text) query;
    icrc1_decimals : () -> (nat8) query;
    icrc1_fee : () -> (nat) query;
    icrc1_total_supply : () -> (nat) query;
    icrc1_minting_account : () -> (opt Account) query;
    icrc1_balance_of : (Account) -> (nat) query;
    icrc1_transfer : (TransferArgs) -> (variant { Ok : nat; Err : TransferError });
    icrc1_supported_standards : () -> (vec record { name : text; url : text }) query;
}
```

## Core traits of the standard

### Two-component account structure

ICRC-1 identifies [accounts](https://github.com/dfinity/ICRC-1#account) with a [principal](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/references/ic-interface-spec/#principal) and an optional subaccount.
A subaccount is an arbitrary 32-byte blob.
Below are the arguments against clumping the owner and the subaccount irreversibly on the interface level:

* Having address components unobscured is crucial for interoperability because it allows for more compliant implementations.
  For example, the ICP ledger can turn the address components into an [account identifier](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/references/ledger#_accounts), and ledgers using principals to identify accounts can use [derived principals](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/references/ic-interface-spec/#id-classes) instead.
  Enforcing a specific encoding would harm interoperability.
* The ability to pass account components unaltered removes the need to link complex account identifier computation libraries to each ledger client.
* Having owners and subaccounts in the transaction log enables new kinds of applications.
  For example, it becomes possible to build auxiliary smart contracts acting as replicators indexing the transaction log or sending out notifications (note, however, that the standard [does not specify how to access the transaction log](#unspecified-transaction-structure)).
* Implementations storing unaltered principals and subaccounts allow clients to recover their state fully by replaying records from the transaction log.
* Two-component structure maps well to the [Rosetta API specification of account identifiers](https://www.rosetta-api.org/docs/api_identifiers.html#account-identifier).

### Namespaces

All ICRC-1 [methods](https://github.com/dfinity/ICRC-1#methods) have the `icrc1_` prefix.
This feature allows existing smart contracts to implement ICRC-1 methods without introducing name clashes.

### Unspecified transaction structure

ICRC-1 _does not_ specify the structure of transactions or provide methods for fetching them.
That deliberate design choice enables backward compatibility with existing token ledgers, such as the ICP ledger.
The Ledger & Tokenization working group plans to work on an _optional_ extension specifying the interface for fetching transactions.


### Metadata access

ICRC-1 defines a [generic metadata mechanism](https://github.com/dfinity/ICRC-1#metadata) allowing ledger implementations to define application-specific attributes, such as token logos and URLs (see the [icrc1_metadata](https://github.com/dfinity/ICRC-1#icrc1_metadata-) method).


### Modularity

ICRC-1 is the _base_ standard designed for extension with follow-up specifications as new flows become practical.
Many efficient flows require unique features of the IC platform, such as [Threshold ECDSA signatures](https://medium.com/dfinity/threshold-ecdsa-the-key-ingredient-behind-the-internet-computers-bitcoin-and-ethereum-cf22649b98a1), to become stable and well-understood.
The standard defines the [icrc1_supported_standards](https://github.com/dfinity/ICRC-1#icrc1_supported_standards) method listing all standards the token ledger supports.
This method will allow applications such as wallets and Rosetta API implementations to discover and take advantage of additional features in the future.

The Ledger & Tokenization working group will continue working on a set of extensions recommended (but not required) for all ledger implementations.
Furthermore, anyone can define new extensions and include them into the supported standards list.
For example, existing [DIP20](https://github.com/Psychedelic/DIP20)-compatible ledgers can include DIP-20 into the supported standards list, allowing compatible clients to discover and access the corresponding API.


### Transaction deduplication semantics

ICRC-1 defines a [protocol for transaction deduplication](https://github.com/dfinity/ICRC-1#transaction-deduplication-) to help clients avoid accidental double spending in the presence of temporary networking issues without the need to implement complex recovery mechanisms.


## Interoperability of ICRC-1 and the ICP ledger

The DFINITY Foundation plans to implement the ICRC-1 interface in the ICP ledger canister smart contract.
Though ICRC-1 is compatible with the ICP ledger design, transferring funds to 28-byte ICP account identifiers will not be possible through the ICRC-1 interface.
You will have to use the existing ICP ledger interface for such transfers.


## Conclusion

The [Ledger & Tokenization working group](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/announcing-token-standard-as-topic-of-the-first-meeting-of-the-ledger-tokenization-working-group/11925/1) proposes to adopt the [ICRC-1](https://github.com/dfinity/ICRC-1) token standard as a common interface for transferring fungible tokens on the Internet Computer.
The standard does not seek to replace existing token ledgers but rather to serve as a base interface for accessing them.
The working group agrees to implement, integrate, and promote the standard and work on its extensions.                                                                                

## What we vote on
* We present a design proposal for the community fund (CF). 

## Summary and objective
* The success of the IC is dependent on the services built on the IC. Similar to Ethereum, we envisage that, in the long run, the value of services built on the IC will collectively be worth more than the IC itself.
* The CF introduces the concept of an NNS controlled treasury. The goals of this treasury are to aid the bootstrapping of the SNS DAO ecosystem, and later be able to re-invest in the continued growth of the ecosystem. The NNS will be the decision maker in choosing where its treasury or CF resources are to be invested. This will be extended in the future to support additional community developed governance and fundraising frameworks (i.e. opportunities from these frameworks will also be featured in the Launchpad).
* To allow the CF to create this treasury, community fund neurons will expose their maturity to the risks the CF fund is taking when investing. Maturity of CF neurons will be reduced when the CF decides to make investments. At a later date CF neurons whose maturity was reduced will be rewarded with maturity increases, dependent on the success of the investments the CF has made.
* Involving the maturity of CF neurons instead of their stake in ICP minimizes the impact on the overall ICP tokenomics.

## Proposed design for the community fund
The community fund process can be split into five phases: (1) joining the community fund, (2) making an investment decision, (3) the decentralization sale, (4) participation in SNS governance, and (5) increasing maturity when SNS neurons dissolve. In the following we describe these five phases in more detail.

**Joining and leaving the CF**
* Using a tick-box in the NNS FE dapp, a neuron can join and leave the CF at any time, also during a voting period.

**Voting on investments**
* The CF investment proposal is part of the SNS proposal. It is essentially a statement, like Invest X ICP from the CF into this SNS.
* As a consequence, all NNS neurons will vote on both the creation of an SNS for a dapp and on whether the CF invests into that dapp.

**Decentralization sale**
* If a proposal to create an SNS is adopted, the decentralization sale starts. The maturity of CF neurons is reduced pro rata by an amount related to X.
* If the decentralization sale is successful, the NNS mints X ICP as specified in the proposal. The SNS treasury receives the X ICP. The NNS CF treasury receives SNS neurons corresponding to X ICP. This is provided as a basket of neurons with various dissolve delays.
* If the decentralization sale is not successful, the maturity of CF neurons is increased again by the amount it was decreased by earlier.

**Participation in SNS governance**
* Participation in voting on the SNS proposals is passed through to the CF neurons via hotkeys on the NNS neurons owned by the NNS.
* The voting weight is proportional to the maturity exposed.

**Increasing maturity of CF neurons**
* The NNS CF treasury holds SNS neurons and tokens in its treasury, to be sold at its discretion.
* When a set of neurons from a decentralization sale of an SNS dissolves, the NNS marks to market the value of the dissolved SNS neurons. In the first stage, the marking to market is done by a proposal. In a later stage this could be done by pulling data from a DEX.
* The maturity of CF neurons whose maturity was reduced when an investment in a SNS-controlled dapp was made is increased by the amount determined by the NNS.
* The NNS can sell the tokens from an SNS at a later point in time with the goal to maximize the sale price. After the NNS sells tokens from an SNS, the received ICP will be burned.

                      I want to set the bar low so everyone feels they can create a named neuron. 

 # Goal

As a community, we need more named neurons to increase decentralization. So I want to create a neuron that inspires regular people to make an NNS proposal and have their neuron named. 

 # Why you should approve this proposal: 

It is pretty simple, do you like decentralization? I would just be another named neuron on the list, and hopefully, I would inspire other people to create named neurons. Everyone should be allowed to be a named neuron. It should be decentralized. Honestly, it is ridiculous I have to beg for votes. 

 # How I will vote?

I will keep voting just like I always have, in a sluggish manner. I do not have time to be a full-time named neuron, and this neuron will not work this way. Instead, I will follow ICDevs.org for 99% of all proposals and will only manually vote for those I deem essential. I reserve the right to change who I follow and when I do, I will post on Twitter. I often talk about how I vote and why I vote on Twitter.


 # What do I deem necessary?

I want to make sure ICP grows. Everything I do, every vote I cast will be towards what I think will help people want to join ICP.

Now that the CF fund is about to become reality, NNS voting is monetarily incentivized more than ever. We need to decentralize the known neurons to ensure only quality projects get accepted.

NNS 系统是 IC 网络的最高权限，决定了网络中一切重要事务（经济学、添加节点与子网、路线图等），因此 NNS 的去中心化决定着 IC 网络的去中心化程度。

显然，当前 IC 网络并不足够去中心化，可命名的神经元（公开的可跟随神经元）还不够多，少数神经元持有很大比例的投票权，这限制了治理水平。ICP League 的命名神经元将加速去中心化进程。

同时，有大量的早期神经元并没有参与治理（许多需要使用命令行来投票），这让他们并没有与 IC 网络的整体发展紧密联系在一起。ICP League 会制作更易用的工具来帮助他们参与，并通过社区的力量激发他们的积极性。

### 我们会为 IC 与 NNS 做些什么？

- 我们一直是 ICP 的[忠实布道者](https://qbw7d-giaaa-aaaaj-aalta-cai.ic0.app/)，我们将继续向整个 crypto 社区介绍 IC 网络的思想与特性，吸引更多的潜在用户与开发；
- 我们有一只优秀的研究者与工程师团队，我们经常输出一些[研究文章与生态报告](https://qbw7d-giaaa-aaaaj-aalta-cai.ic0.app/media)，帮助社区理解网络中正在发生什么，NNS 在做什么；
- 我们为 NNS 制作了[更易用的前端页面](https://qbw7d-giaaa-aaaaj-aalta-cai.ic0.app/nns)，并同时制作了移动端（未来上线），让用户更方便的参与治理；
- 我们将围绕 NNS 制作更多治理相关的工具，并帮助更多社区/个人成为治理领导者。

### 我们的行事准则

ICP League 99% 的时间中都会自主投票，而不会去跟随已有的命名神经元。我们的研究者与工程师团队将对每一个治理提案进行分析，并将其内容广播给社区。以下是我们的投票准则：

- 我们会鲜明地反对垃圾提案，但会去探索更合理的治理机制；
- 我们会更多地站在非官方的社区角度，在我们的决策中，开发者的观点占 60%，社区与投资者的观点占 40%；
- 我们将更多地去团结 DFINITY 的早期投资者，特别是华语社区；
- 我们与 IC 网络的长期利益紧密相关，因此我们会反对短视的刺激毒药和旁氏设计；
- 我们将尝试加速 IC 网络的去中心化，比如赞同其他命名神经元的申请；
- 对于 IC 的系统层设计，我们赞同无准入的设计，反对任何对应用层的限制与歧视；
- 对与需要 NNS 投票的 DApp 相关提案，我们将更倾向于通过，来削减 DApp 的成本；
- 我们更加密原生，会更积极的推动密码学、可组合性、安全性等方面的进展。

### 我们是谁？

ICP League 是一个非盈利的社区与孵化器组织，我们支持 IC 地开发者创建产品和服务，建立易用的基础设施，并更多的 Web3 的传播理念。

ICP League 在 2017 年 2 月建立了全球第一个 DFINITY&ICP 社区，在 2019-2021 年间我们的社区获得了巨大的增长，举办了多次线上与线下活动。同时，我们成功支持了多个创业者在 IC 上构建服务。

### Why we want to become a named neuron?

The NNS system has the highest authority in Internet Computer network, it is authorised to make decisions in all important tasks within this network, includes Economics, nodes or subnodes incasement, roadmaps and so on. Thus, the decentralisation of NNS is also the decentralisation of IC network.

It is safe to say that the current IC network does not demonstrate decentralisation, the named Neurons, in other words, public and traceable neurons, are not enough. Certain group of neurons hold a significant proportion of voting power, in which limits the governance. The named neuron of ICP League will accelerate the process of decentralisation.

Meanwhile, there are significant number of early neurons did not participate in governance, many of them require command lines to vote, in which led them less bounded with the total development of IC network. ICP League is promised to develop user-friendlier tools to help them to involve, enhance their enthusiasm by the community force.

### What will we do for IC and NNS?

- We have been [loyal preachers](https://qbw7d-giaaa-aaaaj-aalta-cai.ic0.app/) of ICP for long time. We are going to continually promote the ideas and characteristics of IC network. We will bring more potential users and developers.

- We have a superior team of researchers and engineers. They have helped us to make [research articles and ecosystem reports](https://qbw7d-giaaa-aaaaj-aalta-cai.ic0.app/media). We have helped the community to understand the circumstances of the Network and NNS and we will keep doing so.

- We have made a more user-friendlier [front page](https://qbw7d-giaaa-aaaaj-aalta-cai.ic0.app/nns) for NNS and making the mobile platform that is launching very soon. We want to make sure users can participate in governance in a more convenient way.

- We are going to develop more tools for NNS, help more communities or individuls to take governance leaders roles.

### Our principles

ICP League will apply self-voting out of 99% time, rather than following an existing named neuron. Our researchers and engineers will analyse every single governance proposal, and broadcast its core to community. Our voting principles are state below:

- We are determined of against junk proposals, but we will explore more reasonable governance mechanism.

- We would stand with non-official communities, and we will make our decision based on this proportion: 60% weight on developers, while 40% on communities and invertsors.

- We will unite more early investors of DFINITY, especially those who are in Chinese communities.

- We are tied up with the interests of IC network in long term, therefore we will against short-sighted, poisoned simulations or Ponzi.

- We are going to accelerate the decentralisation of IC network, for instance, we will support other applications on naming neurons.

- We endorse the design of permissionless, and we against any other limitation or discrimination towards application layer.

- We prefer to approve proposals from DApps that requires NNS voting, so that they can save cost.

- We are crypto natives, we are going to be more active on the process of cryptography, composability, safety etc.

### Who are we?

ICP League is a non-profit community and incubator. We support developers of IC to make products and services, to build more user friendlier infrastructures, and spread the spirits of Web3.

ICP League founded the first DFINITY & ICP community back in February, 2017. We have grow enormously in 2019 till 2021. We have hosted many online and real-time events. Meanwhile, we have successfully supported many entrepreneurs to establish their services on IC.

Hello everyone,

I am submitting this proposal on behalf of The Fools' Court (TFC). If you are not familiar with TFC I would ask that you please take a moment to read our [original announcement](https://twitter.com/thefoolscourt_/status/1519428364683075589?s=20&t=jt-i5j1X9hlpvUmshq7Lnw). 


## Who are we?

### Jester.icp 

I am a husband, a father of 2, and an engineer. I am an Embedded Systems Architect by occupation, with a focus on Cybersecurity & Anti-Tamper. I joined the Internet Computer (IC) community just prior to the genesis event. I am a proud member of the 8 year gang, and I am strong advocate for decentralization through community representation. I do not believe in absolutes, but I do have strong convictions. I cannot promise that I will always vote the same way. What I can promise is that I will always vote for what I believe to be in the best interest of the network and our community.

[Interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRJRdpgKhQY)

### Andrew Weed

I am a staunch privacy and sentient rights advocate. I will always vote with my convictions. I'm for the decentralization of information and technology, because that coincides with individual sovereignty and freedom. I will always vote for increasing the security of the Internet Computer.

### Pwoseidonn

Creator of JudgementDAO, which is currently developing a practical, fair, unbiased and professional community-driven approach to project evaluations.

## Why do we want to become a named neuron?

The development team is at a bit of a crossroads. We want the court to have representation on the NNS, but the technology that enables true community ownership of a neuron is just not ready yet. The political landscape on the NNS is very amenable to new named neurons. We are very excited for these new community champions, but we fear that this dynamic could change dramatically before the court has a chance to create our neuron. For this reason, the development team would like to sponsor the registration of a TFC neuron that will act as a temporary voting neuron until such time that we can replace it with the permanent one.


## How would that work?

The current team neuron will be registered as The Fools Court on the NNS. Eventually, we will create a canister-controlled neuron and pass control of it to our DAO. At that time, we will configure the team neuron to follow the DAO-controlled neuron. Afterwards, we will petition the NNS to remove the old neuron from the list and replace it with the new neuron. By doing so, we can effectively migrate our existing followers to the DAO neuron while we wait for them to update their follower settings. All new followers would simply select “The Fools’ Court” from the NNS and start following the DAO neuron.


## Neuron Information

Neuron ID:  7766735497505253681

The temporary neuron has been configured to follow Weed, Pwo, and I on all governance proposals and ICDevs for technical proposals. We intend to invite additional voting members to join our temporary neuron. These additional members will be announced if/when they accept.

This serves two purposes:

1. Provide a stronger guarantee that the neuron will always vote.
2. Better represent the community's interests.


## What are we trying to build (what is TFC)?

There will be two major components of TFC:

### The Governance System

The primary objective of The Fools' Court is to advance and maintain decentralization of the NNS. If you were to classify the NNS as a layer 1 governance network, then TFC would be a layer 2 governance solution. We believe that (eventually) the cost of ICP will become so great that the average citizen won't be able to contribute meaningfully on the NNS. The TFC DAO will provide an alternative staking solution that provides an incentive for even the smallest contributor. At the same time, we want to use TFC as a proving ground for advanced governance techniques that can't be easily implemented on the NNS.

### Community Services

In order to grow our community and sustain our operations we intend to offer low cost services for developers in the ecosystem. This can be anything from a barebones NFT launchpad to a shared DAO infrastructure. All services will be placed under control of the DAO and funds will be deposited in a community managed treasury.


**Disclaimer: Nothing described above exists today. All contributions are being made by ourselves, our partners, and our community members. If you are interested in helping us achieve our vision please reach out.**
                           # Upgrade frontend NNS Dapp canister to commit `eb545a78247883615de0d71771efa1f5670f6b15`
Wasm sha256 hash: `84654e1d4ea8b435f79d7e1486220450f03406a9b97524e9214e9ff288ba8e96`

# Security patch update

In accordance with the Security Patch Policy and Procedure that was adopted in proposal [48792](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/48792), the source code that was used to build this release will be exposed only after the fix is deployed to the IC.


The community will be able to retroactively verify the binaries that were rolled out. The procedure for rebuilding the binaries and obtaining the sha256 sums of the rolled out binaries will be:

```
git clone https://github.com/dfinity/nns-dapp.git
cd nns-dapp
git checkout eb545a78247883615de0d71771efa1f5670f6b15
./scripts/docker-build
sha256sum nns-dapp.wasm
```

The computed hash should match the hash of the wasm in this proposal

## who am I?  
  
I am ysyms and this neuron votes on proposals on my own behalf only.  
My home page is [ysyms.icp.page](https://ysyms.icp.page/)  
My Twitter: [@ai_ccp251th](https://twitter.com/AI_ccp251th)  
  
## How will I vote if I become a named neuron?  
  
Unless there is a force majeure, I will manually vote on all motion proposals.  
  
For proposals on other topics,I mainly follow DFINITY to vote, but occasionally manually vote myself.  
  
For proposals that vote no with me, I will explain the reasons on the social platform.  
  
## What am I doing for IC?  
  
Produce videos and articles about IC, answer community questions, participate in governance, and submit bugs and suggestions for projects in the IC ecosystem.  
Projects may be built in IC in the future.

## About spam proposals  
  
I am against lowering the motion proposal weight as a temporary solution for the following reasons:  
  
1. I do not think this solution completely removes the incentive to initiate spam proposals  
2. I do not think increasing the rejection cost of proposals again will completely remove the incentive to initiate spam proposals  
3. Even if it does fix the spam proposal, is this result really what everyone wants? Why do we need to maintain the rewards of silent neurons after designing an economic system that has to vote on proposals to get rewards? So without modifying the reward system, I am against taking away our high yields in this way.  
  
  
  
If there are no other solutions in September then I will test if anyone still supports my spam proposal.  
  
  
Sorry for the spam proposals in the past, considering they may be stuck in NNS forever, maybe we can mitigate their impact. I agree to delete/hide all my spam proposals after the spam proposal incentive is completely eliminated, at that point I will re-send a proposal to ask NNS to agree to delete or hide some of my proposals.

## 我是谁？  
  
我是ysyms，该神经元仅代表我个人对提案投票。  
我的主页是[ysyms.icp.page](https://ysyms.icp.page/)  
我的推特：[@ai_ccp251th](https://twitter.com/AI_ccp251th)  
  
## 如果成为命名神经元我将如何投票？  
  
除非遭遇不可抗力因素，我会对所有动议提案手动投票。  
  
对于其他主题的提案，大多数情况我会跟随dfinity投票，但偶尔也会自己手动投票。  
  
对与我投no的提案，我将会在社交平台中说明原因。  
  
## 我正在为IC做什么？  
  
制作有关IC的视频与文章、解答社区问题、参与治理并为IC生态中的项目提交bug与建议。  
未来可能会在IC构建项目。

## 关于垃圾提案  
  
我反对降低动议提案权重作为临时解决方案，原因如下：  
  
1. 我不认为该方案能完全消除发起垃圾提案动机  
2. 我不认为再次增加提案的拒绝成本能够完全消除发起垃圾提案的动机  
3. 即便它真的能够修复垃圾提案，但这样的结果真的是大家想要得到吗？为什么我们设计了一个必须对提案投票才能获得奖励的经济系统后，还要去维护静默神经元的收益？所以在不修改奖励系统的情况下，我反对以这种方式夺走我们的高收益.  
  
  
  
如果在9月份没有其他解决方案那么我会测试是否还有人支持我发送垃圾提案。  
  
  
对过去的垃圾提案感到抱歉，考虑到它们可能会永远停留在NNS与区块链浏览器中，也许我们能够减轻它们的影响。我同意在彻底消除垃圾提案激励后删除/隐藏我的所有垃圾提案，到那时我会重新发起一份提案以请求NNS同意删除或隐藏我的一些提案。

## Who Am I? 
Hello everyone, thanks for taking the time to read my Named Neuron Proposal, I’m Accumulating.icp - I’m 20 years old, and work at a CNC shop designing autoCAD blueprints. I’ve been involved in the Internet Computer Ecosystem since Genesis, and have luckily had the chance to watch our ecosystem flourish into what it is now. I’ve been blessed with the opportunity of being able to call myself a; Founder, Holder, Developer, and end-user within in our ecosystem. I am a proud member of the 8 year gang, a DeFi fanatic, and most importantly, an accumulator. 

Twitter - [@accumulatingicp](https://twitter.com/accumulatingicp)   

## What are my Intentions with the Named Neuron? 
My motivation behind this neuron is to contribute to the further decentralization of the network, while simultaneously providing a followee that I believe will represent the best interests of retail & Accumulators of the Internet Computer. While we have a few great named neurons, recent events have shown that we desperately need more - so I’ve decided to take on this role to encourage as many informed voters as possible!

## How will Governance work?

The Accumulators’ Neuron will only vote in regards to governance topics - all topics other than governance will be delegated to the DFINITY Foundation, until a trusted, third-party named-neuron exists for the purpose of auditing DFINITYs code. Similarly, in the instance I am unable to vote on a governance topic, the vote will be delegates to a trusted, third-party named neuron. In regards to how I will vote on a topic, I will preface a conversation (Discussions are currently on twitter, but may switch to DSCVR / Taggr) regarding the proposal, and give my opinion on it. These discussions will always begin with an informed opinion, that has been considered to reflect the best interests of the Accumulators of the Internet Computer. The topic will then be open for discussion, until we feel as though a general consensus / understanding has been reached (meaning I’m open to having my opinion changed), which will influence how the Named Neuron votes.

# NNS Proposal: New Exchange Rate Mechanism
 
Author: Thomas Locher (DFINITY Foundation)
 
## 1. Objective
 
The goal is to replace the current ICP/XDR conversion rate mechanism with a more general, decentralized mechanism based on an exchange rate canister that will be developed if the motion proposal is accepted.
 
The exchange rate canister, running in a system subnet, will enable any canister to request the exchange rate between any pair of fiat currency and cryptocurrency - including pairs of fiat currencies and pairs of cryptocurrencies. It will further be possible to request rates in the recent past.
 
## 2. Background
 
The current mechanism relies on external conversion rate providers to provide an up-to-date ICP/XDR rate every 10 minutes.
This mechanism has several shortcomings: It creates many proposals daily, which are voted on automatically,i.e., there is no proper decentralized voting process around these proposals. Moreover, constant monitoring is required to ensure that the conversion rate providers operate correctly.
 
## 3. Why this is important
 
The new mechanism completely gets rid of conversion rate proposals. Since there is no need to use dedicated conversion rate providers to update the ICP/XDR rate, the new mechanism is fully decentralized.
 
As an added benefit, the ICP/cycles rate could be updated more frequently than once every 10 minutes if a higher level of granularity became a requirement for some applications. Finally, the exchange rate canister provides a more powerful exchange rate API, which can be leveraged by other applications, e.g., in the DeFi space.
 
## 4. Pros
 
* Exchange rate proposals are no longer required.
* A fully decentralized mechanism is used for the ICP/XDR exchange rate.
* Application canisters can request exchange rates directly from the exchange rate canister.
 
# 5. Cons
 
* The XDR rate is computed based on the received FOREX data, which will only approximate the rate published by the IMF.

# Proposal for Named Neuron - RawTech Venture

## who am I?
We are RawTech Venture, a web3 tech-lead venture fund, aiming at investing blockchain infrastructure from layer0 to layer2, and revolutionary Dapps based on IC ecosystem.                                                                                                 
- Firstly, we are not just a venture but have over 50 engineers in house and have been researching deeply on cross chain and filecoin network(which is in the decentralized storage domain), so that we have the ability to offer tech support for projects no matter whether we invested or not.                                                                                                  
- Second, we have already invested the projects inner IC network such as Catalyze, Canistore, Filswan, Dmail, hola pocket and etc. So compared with other candidates, we are looking from very different angles as both investor and eco-builder.   
- Third, in order to have a deep and further understanding of IC network, we created a project named chain-cloud,an one-stop compile and deployment platform, which also got ,000 grant in October Last year. We are tightly following up on the newest updates on BTC/ETH integration, HTTPS outcall, ICRC-1 token, storage subnet, SNS, etc. Based on the endeavor/attempt we tried above, we can confidently say that IC is going to have a bright future and we will catch up continuously with the growth of IC.

## Why we apply for the named neuron?
As a constructioner in IC, it's definitely great if we can become a KOL or community leader cause everyone can express point of views but not everyone can use their voice to speak out loud to the whole community and followed by fans. So we apply for the named neuron and are willing to share our skills, cognition, products to community and projects in IC chain.                                                                                                 
- From the angle of investors, we'll insist to vote YES to more proposals on behalf of all the ICP token holders, help to increase the token price, help to attract more capitals in to promote the development of IC ecosystem.
- From the angle of tech developers, we are going to suggest both the IC official team and other developers to focus more on the priorities among all the functions planned to be achieved. For instance, at this stage, we think it's much more important to unify token standard, integrate BTC and attract UDSC/USDT such kind of stable coins in to enhance defi domain to increase TVL, instead of taking lots of time and energy to research on edge network, subnet split,subnet rent, people party, etc(not mean these are not necessary but just not so important and urgent at present). Also, we'll suggest IC team to outsource some work and function to eco-developers rather than do all the stuff themselves which can both increase efficiency and show more dao spirit to community.  
- From the angle of community members, on the one hand, we'll continuously collect public's requirements and voice. On the other hand, we'll vote for proposals representing the interest of community instead of IC official team or third party.

## What shall we do to proceed with the development of IC?                                                                                                 
It's quite good to open the channel that allow every single NNS free to choose which one to follow and it shows the spirit of community autonomy. If we are honored to become the named neuron, we'll insist to keep openmind and justice to propose and implement proposals promoting the development of IC network.                                                                                                 
1. We'll set a committee with 8 members(2 researchers, 2 investors, 3 tech engineers, 1 community operator), responsible for voting proposals in position of community, developers as well as investors.  
2. We'll never follow neurons which have relations with IC team. We'll review and evaluate every proposal autonomy and think twice from our professional angle.                                                                                                 
3. For those important proposals, we'll not just vote but also broadcast the info and different point of views to more who pay attention to IC network. Attract more eyesight and power into IC and build a more democratic and decentralized network.  
4. We'll be opposed to proposals without a long term eyesight and look high for short term, and also we'll put the revise opinion to improve these proposals.                                                                                                 
5. We'll take more endeavor and time to promote the Defi related proposals, cause we think it's quite important to boost the ecosystem and attract more developers and projects joining in IC.  
6. We'll support more and more named neurons which are coming from other communities and representing different interest groups.                                                                                                 
 
## Neuron information                                                                                                 
- Name: RawTech Venture                                                                                                 
- Neuron id: 6362091663310642824                                                                                                 
- Description: This is a neuron that belongs to an RawTech Venture.                                                                                                 
 
## Conclusion                                                                                                 
All in all, we are pleased to call all NNS to vote for us becoming named neuron. We'll always be open, justice and creative to take our voting power and responsible for those followers who follow our NNS. Our voting committee will continuously working on both proposing and voting for proposals, and permanently on behalf of the community interest rather than a small group of interest.

                                            Because control of the cycle_dao neuron has been transferred to Arthur Falls, a proposal is submitted to change the name of the neuron to “Arthur’s Neuron (used to be cycle_dao)” 

The description will be the following: “This neuron used to be controlled by cycle_dao. It is now controlled by an individual, Arthur Falls. It will vote on all proposals. Subjects of concern for the controller are protocol stability, healthy economics, token holder rights, node provider incentivisation, better governance, DFINITY accountability, and DFINITY non-participation in the application layer.” 

This is intended to reflect the flexibility of a personally controlled named neuron rather than act as a policy document or constitution.

Thank you in advance for your support.

## About Me

I enjoy writing software, designing interfaces, and building developer tools.

I’m involved in various aspects of the Internet Computer (the IC) but that is not something I consider to be a core part of my identity.

I also wouldn’t say that I identify as a “crypto” or “web3” person and I think that gives me a certain perspective on things.

## My Experience

I used to work as a Software Engineer at DFINITY on the SDK, among other things.

You may be familiar with some of my work from that time:

* I wrote the first version of `dfx`.
* I started the Motoko Language Server project.
* I added support for compiling the Motoko compiler to JavaScript, and created a web-based Motoko editor with Language Server support.
* A lot of the first Motoko code I wrote made it into the `motoko-base` package.

More recently, I was a mentor and speaker at Motoko Bootcamp. A recording of my talk is available here:

https://youtu.be/GFenqSGhj7I

I regularly attend the weekly DFINITY Dev community call on Discord and volunteer my time in a number of the technical working groups.

I’m currently working full-time building something on the IC and hope to share more on that publicly very soon. I also want to build useful tools and share them with the developer community.

My philosophy towards building on the IC is that I would prefer to discover challenges and explore solutions to them than to move functionality off-platform.

## Voting

I am an individual and will be voting in my own interests. Those interests may change over time. I have, however, invested a lot of time and effort into the IC and I would like to see it succeed.

I am not committing to manually vote on every proposal but my intent is for my neuron to always vote. It will initially follow ICDevs.org for _Governance_ and the DFINITY Foundation for _All Topics Except Governance_. I will manually vote when I am able to, or when I feel it is necessary.

_Aside: I would like to normalize having named neurons regardless of whether they vote manually or not. If unintended consequences arise from this, I would like to see the NNS improved as a result._

I anticipate that my manual voting will be aligned with improving the experience for people building on the IC and for end users, as well as generally to approve things that I think will make the IC more successful.

## Disclaimer

I reserve the right to change how I vote at any time, including any follow relationships. If at any time you disagree with how I am voting you may unfollow my neuron.

# Proposal for Named Neuron — ICPMANUAL

### Who Are We?

We’re a three-man crypto-enthusiast team consisting of creators and editors of an informational and educational resource called «The Internet Computer Academy». We are also community grant receivers as the moderators and developers of the official Russian-speaking IC community.  For the last 8 months we have been constantly developing and shaping  the Russian-speaking community of Internet Computer enthusiasts from all over the world.

We have created a successful conglomerate of informational resources in various social networks helping the Russian-speaking community promptly receive all the relevant information about the development of the Internet Computer ecosystem and the protocol which has significantly lowered the entrance threshold for new adepts of the IC ecosystem.

We keep our fingers on the pulse of the eco-system and thoroughly select and translate into Russian all the most important pieces of information like blog posts, forum posts, tweets and so on, so that our local community stays one of the best informed non-English speaking communities out there.

### Our media includes:

[icpmanual.ru](https://icpmanual.ru) website | complete information about the ecosystem and protocol, whitepaper, instructions, NFT, news, reviews, wallets, explorer 

[informational and educational telegram channel «Internet Computer Academy»](https://t.me/icpmanual) | protocol and ecosystem news, overviews of new features, instructions, translations of articles and proposals for NNS governance | (1363 subscribers*)

[official telegram group of the Russian-speaking Internet Computer community](https://t.me/InternetComputer_RU) | technical and informational support from administrators [@murza13, @NavigatorDFN, @Lioks_Karbach], discussing important issues of NNS governance, briefing new members of the community | (709 subscribers*)

[social network portal in DSCVR «RU ICPFAMILY»](https://dscvr.one/p/ru-icpfamily) (1506 subscribers*)

[Twitter profile](https://twitter.com/icpmanual) (200 subscribers*)

*as of 3rd of September

### Our main activities are:

Increasing the education and awareness within the community;
technical support;
positive image and positioning of the IC project;
formation of a vision for the long-term prospects of the project;
formation of a community of long-term investors;
involving the community in the management of the network through NNS;
combating organized FUD/spam attacks and fighting misinformation;
increasing of the adoption of the Internet Identity technology;
increasing the adoption of IC blockchain based products and of their user base;
formation of a community as a solid foundation of the IC project;

### Why are we pretending to name our neuron?

We have done a lot of work in building a local IC community, and we continue to develop and improve all aspects of our work. We have brought new members into the community who are not just ordinary users, but are also investors and developers of the infrastructure, analytical projects, games and registries of products on the IC blockchain, creators of NFT collections. All of them need a representative governance voice, which we hope to implement through the named neuron.

We are working hard to inspire more people to join our community of aspiring crypto enthusiasts and are carrying out media expansion into other crypto projects.

During the deliberation process, we hope to engage in discussions community members with diverse backgrounds to achieve the most optimal decisions with the information available to us.

### Our goals

We are sure that the community plays one of the key roles in the development of any blockchain ecosystem. Our goal is to expand and develop the local community we have already built, as well as the creation of a re-elected committee that would initiate discussions on various management issues, make decisions on voting on behalf of the community, which would share the principles of freedom of speech, faith in pluralism of opinions as unchangeable component of a free creative community that can generate and translate into reality the most ambitious ideas.

Such an educated and motivated community will become a solid foundation for the future decentralized development of the Internet Computer blockchain. Together we will build the Internet of the future.

### Neuron information:

Name: ICPMANUAL  
Neuron ID: 5728549712200490799  
Description: ICPMANUAL neuron

### Conclusion

We would really appreciate it if the global IC community supports our initiative. To infinity and beyond!

upcoming proposal to add a named neuron.

Neuron ID: 12911334408382674412

# About Me

For a long while I’ve been a contributor to various open source projects and
communities, including Emacs, Haskell, Ledger, C++, Common Lisp, Rust and Coq.
You could say I’m a technology enthusiast, always looking to learn about new
ideas and how they connect to real systems.

I worked at DFINITY from 2018-2022, exiting as Principal Engineer after nearly
4 years. While there, I worked on the execution engine, integration testing,
devops infrastructure, transitioning from Haskell to Rust, the NNS,
tokenomics, and various other aspects of the system. I knew the full stack
fairly well, and had moved to the research side of the organization about a
year before I left. This allowed me to work alongside most teams in the
organization at one point or another.

# Voting

The neuron I’m proposing to name is the first neuron I staked, just a few
weeks after initial launch. For most proposals I follow ICP Maximalist, but
this is not how I always vote. I have a strong interest in seeing the Internet
Computer become more decentralized and friendly to both its stakeholders and
the public interest — and this is how I intend to vote.

# Disclaimer

Although I plan to always vote, whether manually or by following, I do not
commit to any particular platform. I will vote my conscience and hold to what

## [“if you dont trust the people in DFINITY or the tech we are building, feel free to join other blockchain ecosystems”--From Herbert, Head of DFINITY Asia](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/who-allows-dfinity-employees-to-represent-icp-officials/15314/10?u=ysyms)  
  
Is this what DFINITY really thinks? No wonder you don’t care about the design of on-chain governance, no wonder you set up a centralized organization to be responsible for node review, no wonder you operate the official community on behalf of IC, it turns out that DFINTY hopes to reshape an Internet that must trust DFINITY, thank you for reminding me,I will not continue to stake any ICP and let DFINITY buy voting weight with its own money.

## [“如果你不信任 DFINITY 的人或我们正在构建的技术，请随时加入其他区块链生态系统”——来自 DFINITY 亚洲负责人 Herbert](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/who-allows-dfinity-employees-to-represent-icp-officials/15314/10?u=ysyms)  
  
这才是DFINITY的真实想法吗？怪不得你们不在意链上治理的设计，怪不得你们成立一个中心化组织负责节点审查，怪不得你们代表IC运营官方社区，原来DFINTY是希望重塑一个必须信任DFINITY的互联网，感谢你们提醒我，我不会再质押任何ICP，让DFINITY拿自己的钱去买投票权重吧。

Motivation: Finalize the replacements started with proposal [79812](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/79812)                                                                                         
  
## Who are we?  
  
We are from the [ICP 8yeargang信仰群](https://oc.app/#/a6ew7-jyaaa-aaaaf-adsaq-cai) , the number one Chinese language community in Openchat.  
  
We are a group of NFH (Non-Fungible Human) who love ICP, respect diversity, and encourage inward (philosophy) - outward (knowledge) exploration in both directions.  
  
Any member who display their 8-year NNS staking screenshot can become a group administrator, and eventually the community will be completely decentralized.  
  
## keywords  
  
Love, Link, belong, Inclusion, Dedication, Co-creation  
  
## Slogan  
  
Create value for every ICP 8yeargang  
  
## What are we doing?  
  
We are building a spiritual home that truly belongs to the ICP 8 yeargang community, and we believe that  
  
- Beyond making money, we are more interested in exploration new possibilities on IC;  
  
- Share the vision of ICP and expand our Chinese language community;  
  
- Driven by curiosity rather than opportunism.  
  
## Where are we going?  
  
ICP 8yeargang is sowing seeds of freedom, the sunlight is fair to all, where these seeds will potentially grow towards an unimaginable shape and size.  
  
## Why we want to become a named neuron?  
  
After an 8-year staking, we put our entire trust and enthusiasm on participation of NNS. As the largest Chinese community in OC, it is our responsibility to lead the entire community members to be deeply involved in the daily governance of NNS, specifically we will  
  
- Make sure NNS proposal is well understood in the Chinese language community, be the bridge between NNS and community.  
  
- Answer members questions.  
  
- Vote by community representatives to create a consensus community vote  
  
- Work and communicate with every member to make sure the proposal is best represented.  
  
We believe it is important to be the naming neuron of 8yeargang because we always look at governance issues from both a macro (top-down) and community (bottom-up) perspective. Because of this unique perspective, we hope to gain the acceptance of the IC community and become an important representative force for public participation in NNS governance.

## 我们是谁?  
  
我们来自Openchat第一大中文社区 [ICP 8yeargang信仰群](https://oc.app/#/a6ew7-jyaaa-aaaaf-adsaq-cai)  

我们是一群热爱IC，尊重差异，鼓励向内（哲学）-向外（求知）的双向探索的NFH(Non-Fungible Human)  
  
任何公开自己8年质押证明的成员都可以成为群管理，最终社区将实现完全去中心化管理  
  
## 关键词  
  
爱，链接，归属，包容，奉献，共创  
  
## 口号  
  
为每个ICP 8yeargang创造价值  
  
## 我们在做什么?  
  
我们正在建立一个真正属于ICP 8yeargang社区的精神家园，我们认为：  
  
不单单以赚钱为目的，更是探索与学习  
  
不急于排斥扩大规模，更愿意志同道合  
  
不过度盲目追逐风口，更鼓励兴趣为之  
  
## 我们要去哪  
  
ICP 8yeargang是一片孕育自由和真实种子的土壤，在这里，每一寸阳光都是公平的，这些种子未来成长出的样子我们无法想象  
  
## 为什么我们要成为命名神经元？  
  
作为8年质押的ICP忠实信徒，没有什么能比深入参与NNS治理更神圣的工作了，作为OC最大中文社区，有责任带领整个社区成员深入参与NNS的日常治理工作，具体而言我们将：  
  
- 针对每一个NNS提案对所有成员进行宣讲, 成为NNS与社区之间的桥梁。  
  
- 对于成员的疑问进行解答。  
  
- 通过社区代表投票最终形成社区投票共识  
  
- 集合社区的智慧，提出对生态有价值的提案  
  
我们认为8yeargang成为命名神经元至关重要，因为我们始终同时站在宏观（自上而下）和社区（自下而上）两个角度看待治理问题，正因为这样独特的视角，我们希望能够获得IC社区的认同，成为大众参与NNS治理的重要代表力量。

# Background

The Internet Computer replica software is constantly being further developed, and the nodes powering the Internet Computer regularly switch to a new version. This happens via two steps:

* First, a replica version is "blessed", via a "Bless Replica Version" proposal to the NNS (a recent example is [77589](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/77589)). This adds the replica version to the list of blessed replica versions.
* Second, a subnet upgrades to the new replica version with a "Update Subnet Replica Version" proposal to the NNS (a recent example is [78517](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/78517)). Such a proposal only works if the replica version has previously been "blessed".

**Problem 1**

Currently, replica versions are never removed from the blessed list, and the blessed version list contains more than 100 versions. This poses a small risk: a node that first joins an old subnet may believe (under especially bad networking conditions) that the version that the subnet started out with is still the currently active version, and "upgrade" to the very old version. If this very old version contains a security vulnerability, this creates a security risk.

**Problem 2**

The NNS uses "topics" to group different proposal types together. Neurons can define following based on the topic. For example, many community neurons choose to vote manually on the topic "Governance" (which contains motion proposals), while following the DFINITY foundation on all other topics.

Currently, the vast majority of proposals (excluding exchange rate proposals) are in topic "Subnet Management". This topic includes "Bless replica version" proposals, "Update subnet replica version" proposals, and other frequently used proposal types like "Add/remove node to subnet". This makes it very difficult for a neuron holder to commit to manual voting on this topic: it contains many proposals, and of many different types, each of which you need to inspect and vote on. This may partially explain why the vast majority of neuron holders choose to follow the DFINITY foundation on this topic. This is not desirable, because voting should be as decentralized as possible.

# Proposed changes

We propose to make two changes: (1) introduce a new proposal type that removes replica versions from the "blessed" list, and (2) split the NNS proposal topic "Subnet Management" into more fine-grained topics.

**Retire replica versions (addresses problem 1)**

We propose to add a new proposal type called "Retire replica versions" that performs the opposite of "Bless replica version". More precisely, such a proposal can specify a list of outdated replica versions, and if the proposal is adopted, all outdated versions will be removed from the blessed versions list. The proposal will fail if:

* The payload is empty
* The payload contains a replica version that is currently not blessed
* The payload contains a replica version that is currently in use

With this new proposal type, a node will never use a replica version that is not blessed, meaning that vulnerabilities in old versions that are no longer blessed cannot pose a security risk anymore.

**New NNS proposal topics (addresses problem 2)**

To make it simpler for neurons to vote manually on certain topics, we propose to split the "Subnet management" topic into multiple topics. More precisely, we propose to add two new topics:

* "Replica Version Management": This topic would contain the existing proposal type "Bless replica version" and the new type "Retire replica versions".
* "Subnet Replica Version Management". This topic would contain only proposal type "Update Subnet Replica Version".

All other proposal types that are currently in topic "Subnet management" will remain in topic "Subnet management".

Some neurons may have [defined following](https://wiki.internetcomputer.org/wiki/How-To:_Set_your_neuron_to_follow_another_neuron) for all the individual specific topics but not the catch-all "all topics except governance". With the introduction of these new topics, such neurons would not have any following defined for the new topics, and risk missing out on voting rewards. To avoid this, we propose that with the introduction of the new topics, the followees for topic "Subnet management" are copied over to the new topics "Replica Version Management" and "Subnet Replica Version". Neuron holders can of course manually adjust their following on these topics after that.

Overall, more fine-grained topics allow neurons to specialize on some topics and manually vote on those topics. For example, with these changes we could imagine that some neurons will decide to manually vote on "Replica Version Management". Other neurons can now follow different experts on different topics, further decentralizing the vote.

        Temporarily reduce block rate of subnet eq6en to avoid nodes falling behind.

Motivation: Finalize the replacements started with proposal [80937](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/80937)   The merits of this proposal are discussed at https://forum.dfinity.org/t/reproposal-spam-prevention-convert-from-system-based-rewards-to-voter-based-rewards/15352.

Proposal: Convert from a system-based rewards model to a voter-based reward model.

The current system determines a reward rate, total supply, and then determines the total reward to give each day by multiplying the (reward rate * the total_supply)/day. The total rewards are then handed out based on each neuron’s share of the total voting weight for the day.

The new system will determine the reward rate and multiply the rate by the weighted vote-completion percentage and bonus rate of each voting neuron.

This will also allow us to move the governance weight back to 20 without incentivising spam. We propose this occur as part of this proposal.

A result of this proposal will be a reduction in total minted ICP due to the fact that some voters do not vote on all proposals or follow a voter for all proposals. In a follow-on proposal, the NNS can determine what to do with that “abandoned” ICP. We suggest an NNS treasury but will leave it to a future proposal to finalize that. The following illustration shows the handing out of rewards in the old vs new system.

NOTE: “Passive” here means someone who has not elected to follow anyone on the governance proposal topic and who does not manually vote. We do not consider people that pro-actively follow experts to be passive and appreciate the time and effort they take to find qualified voters.

The below image is a visual for the change in award distribution:

https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business4/uploads/dfn/original/2X/f/fc0d7484fff35dce6059bcf705e97c35d8b7572b.png

Spam is neutralized because additional proposals will not affect the ability of a neuron to gain rewards. Any neuron’s maximum reward for the day is generated by Reward Rate *(Actual Vote Weight/Possible Vote Weight) * Age Bonus. Adding extra, superfluous heavy weighted votes only increases the Possible Vote denominator and thus does not increase the number of rewards handed out in a day.

Weights can remain in the calculations to encourage participation due to the fact that each voter is only competing against themselves to achieve 100% voting for the day.

This scheme can be easily implemented in the existing code by manipulating the distribute_rewards function to iterate over all considered_proposals, finding the weight of each proposal and creating a target sum. Instead of creating a map of voters_to_used_voting_rights, the map will also need to keep track of each vote’s absolute weight. The reward function on ic/governance.rs at 73983e05ebbab239ce39492a05fb39a83ce5dce5 · https://github.com/dfinity/ic/blob/73983e05ebbab239ce39492a05fb39a83ce5dce5/rs/nns/governance/src/governance.rs#L6059 will need to be adjusted to be used_voting_rights * (total absolute vote weight/target vote weight). The used_voting_rights has the age and lock bonuses built in. (Note - The reward function is mapping twice as much data, so performance may be an issue here).

A worked example:

4 proposals are eligible for rewards on a day. The reward rate is 15%.

Proposal 1 - XDR Exchange Rate - Weight 0.01

Proposal 2 - Subnet management - Weight 1

Proposal 3 - Node Rewards - Weight 1

Proposal 4 - Governance Proposal - Weight 20

Total Possible Vote weight: 22.01.

Voter 1 - Passive whale votes with 10,000 voting reward on proposals 1-3. Total executed weight is 2.01. Thus the reward is 10,000 * (.15/365) *(2.01/22.01 = 0.3752 ICP(~1.3%)

Voter 2 - Active holder votes with 100 voting reward on proposals 1-4. Total executed weight is 22.01. Thus the reward is 100 * (.15/365) *(22.01/22.01 = 0.041 ICP (~15%)

Why Now?

The new exchange rate mechanism(New Exchange Rate Mechanism - https://forum.dfinity.org/t/new-exchange-rate-mechanism/14543 ) will make spam much more attractive. We need a quick fix and this is the quickest route to implementation.

A few more notes from the discussion with the community/foundation(h/t to @bjoernek for compiling):

Proposal: The reward mechanism assumes that everybody votes on all proposals. If you vote on all proposals you get rewards corresponding to your share of voting power compared to the total voting power. You get reduced rewards if you miss votes, but those lost rewards don’t go to active voters.

Impact on total rewards/inflation: This proposal reduces the rewards which are allocated on a daily basis, depending on how many participants miss votes. This reduces inflation. In a second stage (out of scope of this proposal) we could consider allocating these un-distributed rewards to an NNS treasury.

Impact on financial incentives: This proposal removes the direct financial incentive to submit spam proposals, i.e., active votes will not gain additional rewards in case of spam proposals. However there is still an indirect financial incentive as the new mechanism reduces the inflation; this creates a benefit for ICP holders (staked/unstaked)

Impact on reward weights: As this proposal removes the direct financial incentive for spam we could consider to reset the reward weight for governance proposals back to 20.

Implementation effort: This proposal requires only an update of a few lines of code within the function distribute_rewards in governance.rs. Thus this can be implemented relatively quickly.

Why bring up this proposal now again?

In connection with the new exchange rate mechanism we require a quick solution.

Earlier concerns on the ability to influence the inflation rate (and thus also reduce the predictability of total supply) are much less of an issue now, given that maturity modulation included anyway further uncertainty on this.

Connection to periodic confirmation of following: We already have an approved motion proposal for spam prevention namely periodic confirmation of followees. However, this still requires some enhancements wrt to the handling of time-sensitive proposals (for which a few ideas are under discussion). Periodic confirmation of followees could still be valuable, even if this proposal is implemented because it strengthens active voting participation.

Vote Accept to:

Convert from system-based rewards to voter-based rewards
Change the weight of governance proposals back to 20.
Keep track of “abandoned” ICP as a governance-tracked variable.

提议：从基于系统的奖励模型转换为基于投票者的奖励模型。

当前系统确定奖励率，总供应量，然后通过乘以（奖励率 * total_supply）/天来确定每天给予的总奖励。然后根据每个神经元在当天总投票权重中的份额分配总奖励。

新系统将确定奖励率，并将奖励率乘以加权投票完成百分比和每个投票神经元的奖励率。

这也将使我们能够在不激励垃圾邮件的情况下将治理权重移回 20。我们建议将此作为本提案的一部分。

由于一些选民没有对所有提案投票或跟随选民对所有提案进行投票，因此该提案的结果将是总铸造 ICP 的减少。在后续提案中，NNS 可以确定如何处理“废弃”的 ICP。我们建议建立一个 NNS 资金库，但将留给未来的提案来最终确定。下图显示了旧系统与新系统中奖励的发放。

注意：这里的“被动”是指没有选择在治理提案主题上关注任何人并且没有手动投票的人。我们不认为积极追随专家的人是被动的，并欣赏他们为寻找合格选民所花费的时间和精力。

下图是奖励分配变化的视觉效果：

https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business4/uploads/dfn/original/2X/f/fc0d7484fff35dce6059bcf705e97c35d8b7572b.png

垃圾邮件被中和，因为额外的提议不会影响神经元获得奖励的能力。任何神经元当天的最大奖励由奖励率*（实际投票权重/可能投票权重）*年龄奖励产生。添加额外的、多余的权重投票只会增加可能投票的分母，因此不会增加一天内发放的奖励数量。

权重可以保留在计算中以鼓励参与，因为每个选民只与自己竞争以实现当天 100% 的投票。

通过操纵distribute_rewards函数迭代所有考虑的_proposals，找到每个提案的权重并创建一个目标总和，这个方案可以很容易地在现有代码中实现。除了创建 voters_to_used_voting_rights 的地图外，该地图还需要跟踪每个投票的绝对权重。 ic/governance.rs 上的奖励功能在 73983e05ebbab239ce39492a05fb39a83ce5dce5 · https://github.com/dfinity/ic/blob/73983e05ebbab239ce39492a05fb39a83ce5dce5/rs/nns/governance/src/governance.rs#L6059 需要调整（总绝对投票权重/目标投票权重）。 used_voting_rights 具有内置的年龄和锁定奖励。（注意 - 奖励函数映射两倍的数据，因此这里的性能可能是一个问题）。

为什么现在？

新的汇率机制（New Exchange Rate Mechanism - https://forum.dfinity.org/t/new-exchange-rate-mechanism/14543 ）将使垃圾邮件更具吸引力。我们需要快速修复，这是最快的实施途径。

与社区/基金会讨论的更多注释（h/t 至 @bjoernek 进行编译）：

提案：奖励机制假设每个人都对所有提案进行投票。如果您对所有提案进行投票，您将获得与您的投票权份额相对于总投票权的奖励。如果您错过选票，您将获得减少的奖励，但那些失去的奖励不会给活跃的选民。

对总奖励/通货膨胀的影响：该提案减少了每天分配的奖励，具体取决于有多少参与者错过投票。这降低了通货膨胀。在第二阶段（超出本提案的范围），我们可以考虑将这些未分配的奖励分配给 NNS 国库。

对经济激励的影响：该提案消除了提交垃圾提案的直接经济激励，即在垃圾提案的情况下，主动投票不会获得额外奖励。然而，由于新机制降低了通货膨胀，仍然存在间接的经济激励；这为 ICP 持有者带来了好处

Propuesta: Convertir de un modelo de recompensas basado en el sistema a un modelo de recompensas basado en los votantes.

El sistema actual determina una tasa de recompensa, el suministro total, y luego determina la recompensa total para dar cada día multiplicando la (tasa de recompensa * el suministro total)/día. Luego, las recompensas totales se entregan en función de la participación de cada neurona en el peso total de la votación del día.

El nuevo sistema determinará la tasa de recompensa y la multiplicará por el porcentaje ponderado de votación completada y la tasa de bonificación de cada neurona de votación.

Esto también nos permitirá mover el peso de la gobernanza de nuevo a 20 sin incentivar el spam. Proponemos que esto ocurra como parte de esta propuesta.

Un resultado de esta propuesta será una reducción en el ICP acuñado total debido al hecho de que algunos votantes no votan sobre todas las propuestas o siguen a un votante para todas las propuestas. En una propuesta de seguimiento, el NNS puede determinar qué hacer con ese ICP abandonado. Sugerimos una tesorería de NNS, pero lo dejaremos para una propuesta futura para finalizar eso. La siguiente ilustración muestra la entrega de recompensas en el sistema antiguo frente al nuevo.

NOTA: “Pasivo” aquí significa alguien que no ha elegido seguir a nadie en el tema de la propuesta de gobernanza y que no vota manualmente. No consideramos que las personas que siguen proactivamente a los expertos sean pasivas y aprecian el tiempo y el esfuerzo que dedican a encontrar votantes calificados.

La siguiente imagen es una representación visual del cambio en la distribución de premios:

https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business4/uploads/dfn/original/2X/f/fc0d7484fff35dce6059bcf705e97c35d8b7572b.png

El spam se neutraliza porque las propuestas adicionales no afectarán la capacidad de una neurona para obtener recompensas. La recompensa máxima de cualquier neurona para el día se genera por Tasa de recompensa * (Ponderación real de votos/Posible ponderación de votos) * Bonificación por edad. Agregar votos pesados ​​superfluos adicionales solo aumenta el denominador de voto posible y, por lo tanto, no aumenta la cantidad de recompensas que se entregan en un día.

Los pesos pueden permanecer en los cálculos para fomentar la participación debido al hecho de que cada votante solo compite contra sí mismo para lograr el 100% de la votación del día.

Este esquema se puede implementar fácilmente en el código existente al manipular la función distribuir_recompensas para iterar sobre todas las propuestas_consideradas, encontrar el peso de cada propuesta y crear una suma objetivo. En lugar de crear un mapa de votantes_a_los_derechos_de_voto_utilizados, el mapa también deberá realizar un seguimiento del peso absoluto de cada voto. La función de recompensa en ic/governance.rs en 73983e05ebbab239ce39492a05fb39a83ce5dce5 · https://github.com/dfinity/ic/blob/73983e05ebbab239ce39492a05fb39a83ce5dce5/rs/nns/governance/src/governance.rs tendrá que ajustarse a los derechos de votación_9 #L60 * (peso de voto absoluto total/peso de voto objetivo). used_voting_rights tiene incorporados los bonos de edad y bloqueo. (Nota: la función de recompensa asigna el doble de datos, por lo que el rendimiento puede ser un problema aquí).

¿Porqué ahora?

El nuevo mecanismo de tipo de cambio (Nuevo mecanismo de tipo de cambio - https://forum.dfinity.org/t/new-exchange-rate-mechanism/14543 ) hará que el spam sea mucho más atractivo. Necesitamos una solución rápida y esta es la ruta más rápida para la implementación.

Algunas notas más de la discusión con la comunidad/fundación (h/t a @bjoernek por compilar):

Propuesta: El mecanismo de recompensa asume que todos votan en todas las propuestas. Si vota en todas las propuestas, obtiene recompensas correspondientes a su parte del poder de voto en comparación con el poder de voto total. Obtiene recompensas reducidas si pierde votos, pero esas recompensas perdidas no van a los votantes activos.

Impacto en las recompensas totales/inflación: esta propuesta reduce las recompensas que se asignan diariamente, dependiendo de cuántos participantes no votan. Esto reduce la inflación. En una segunda etapa (fuera del alcance de esta propuesta) podríamos considerar asignar estas recompensas no distribuidas a una tesorería NNS.

Impacto en los incentivos financieros: esta propuesta elimina el incentivo financiero directo para enviar propuestas de spam, es decir, los votos activos no obtendrán recompensas adicionales en caso de propuestas de spam.

      # Replace a node in subnet eq6en.

- Step 1 (this proposal): Add nodes [2lhun-vmepu-zc7ic-6lrjj-o4yda-nlmwn-m4i2i-h4oby-hwv4y-mpv7c-fae]
- Step 2 (upcoming proposal): Remove nodes [y7uxu-kv3fw-7fbct-yo4dg-5ldiw-htywq-oxs44-6rhvj-ehgbd-2ssun-3ae]


Motivation: Replace 1 underperforming node  Update subnet io67a-2jmkw-zup3h-snbwi-g6a5n-rm5dn-b6png-lvdpl-nqnto-yih6l-gqe to replica version 6de9963fdc752394475149a9659d42f01ab8b0d3

# About Me

For a long while I’ve been a contributor to various open source projects and communities, including Emacs, Haskell, Ledger, C++, Common Lisp, Rust and Coq. You could say I’m a technology enthusiast, always looking to learn about new ideas and how they connect to real systems.

I worked at DFINITY from 2018-2022, exiting as Principal Engineer after nearly 4 years. While there, I worked on the execution engine, integration testing, devops infrastructure, transitioning from Haskell to Rust, the NNS, tokenomics, and various other aspects of the system. I knew the full stack fairly well, and had moved to the research side of the organization about a year before I left. This allowed me to work alongside most teams in the organization at one point or another.

# Voting

The neuron I’m proposing to name is the first neuron I staked, just a few weeks after initial launch. For most proposals I follow ICP Maximalist, but this is not how I always vote. I have a strong interest in seeing the Internet Computer become more decentralized and friendly to both its stakeholders and the public interest — and this is how I intend to vote.

# Disclaimer

Although I plan to always vote, whether manually or by following, I do not commit to any particular platform. I will vote my conscience and hold to what I, personally, think will serve the interests of the network and its users best.
    Motivation: Remove FR2 nodes from the network in accordance with https://forum.dfinity.org/t/the-state-and-direction-of-decentralization-nodes-on-the-internet-computer/9170/105                   # Replace a node in subnet eq6en.

Motivation: Finalize the replacements started with proposal [81618](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/81618)  The ICP Maximalist Network was started with a core vision of promoting growth within the IC ecosystem. Many members of the ICPMN community contribute to that vision every day. A great example is the ICP Maximalist Network neuron, which has been a successful experiment demonstrating how people who care a lot about NNS governance can have a meaningful voice without owning large bags of ICP. The liquid democracy that currently results from our neuron vote has grown, which naturally surfaces unintended politics. It has become evident that the neuron needs to dissociate from the ICP Maximalist brand. The neuron exists to advance decentralization of the internet computer through leadership in governance participation. The ICP Maximalist Network is a brand that seeks growth in the web3 internet computer ecosystem. These are very different missions and we recognize that using the same name creates confusion in the IC community. Today we are excited to announce that the ICPMN neuron is spinning off as its own organization.

We propose that the ICP Maximalist Network neuron should be renamed to the **Synapse.Vote** neuron. A synapse is a site of communication between neurons in the nervous system, which seems like an appropriate metaphor. While the voting members and the general mission of the ICPMN neuron are not changing, this rebranding will establish it as a separate organization. All of the voting members of the neuron have collaborated on this transition and see it as a positive change for ICPMN and the IC as a whole.

Our manifesto and voting members are listed on our website [Synapse.vote](https://www.synapse.vote/). You are invited to follow the new Synapse neuron on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/SynapseVote) and join the conversation on [Telegram](https://t.me/synapsevote).

## Manifesto

The Voting Members (listed below) of the Synapse neuron are committed to voting in the long term best interest of the Internet Computer. We are a balanced mix of well known IC enthusiasts, investors, developers, and DFINITY Foundation team members. We each bring our own priorities and biases to this neuron and we unapologetically vote on each proposal with our own convictions. Our diversity of thought and background is intended to provide a cross section of the IC ecosystem. Many of us routinely engage with the IC community in discussions about governance topics using a wide variety of social media platforms, but this is not a requirement to be a Voting Member. 

The Synapse neuron will be configured with up to 15 Followees for the Governance topic. It is currently configured to follow DFINITY for All Topics Except Governance topic, but we reserve the right to configure Followees for individual topics in the future when we determine that there are suitable experts in the ecosystem. A core principle of this neuron is that it can be trusted to always vote on all proposals. We actively monitor our participation in all Governance proposals to ensure the neuron votes. Anyone can monitor voting patterns of our neuron and individual voting members using the CrowdGov.org website.

## Voting Members

All voting members listed below are currently configured as Followees for the Governance Topic for the Synapse neuron. Visit our website for more information about each individual and our social media links.

## NNS Proposal Process

This Register Known Neuron proposal will be submitted from neuron ID [12008772471346176261](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/neuron/12008772471346176261), which belongs to Wenzel Bartlett and is used for the purpose of submitting NNS proposals. The mechanism for renaming a known neuron is to submit a new Register Known Neuron governance proposal to the NNS using the new name and the same neuron ID that is currently registered. This was first demonstrated when the cycle_dao neuron was renamed to Arthur’s neuron. We will complete our name transition to Synapse.vote in two phases. The first step will be to submit a proposal to rename the “ICP Maximalist Network” neuron to the “Synapse.vote (formerly ICP Maximalist Network)” neuron. Approx 3 months later we will submit another NNS proposal to rename again to the “Synapse.vote” neuron. The intermediate step will occur so it is obvious that the new name is the same neuron as the old name. We want to give all followers time to recognize that this transition is occurring so they are not surprised when they look at their Followee list and see that the name has changed.

# 1. Introduction

To encourage additional users participating in the governance process of the Internet Computer we suggest adjusting the rules for the minimum dissolve delay and dissolve delay bonus for neurons. In particular, we suggest that the minimum dissolve delay for voting should be set to 1 month (instead of 6 months) and the dissolve delay bonus should be extended by a linear function with values between 0 and 1.0625 for the time between 0 and 6 months. As a consequence, new users will be able to try out the governance process due to the lower minimum dissolve delay, while still keeping the incentive for users staking for longer periods due to much higher voting rewards for long-term staking. 

This proposal describes this change and arguments for and against the change to help you make an informed decision.

# 2. Motivation

On 7th of June 2022 we created a forum post proposing to reduce minimum staking time for expanding governance participation. The community response for the proposal has been great and very engaging. The post received 180 replies with passionate arguments for both for and against the proposal. Overall sentiment from the community was positive and several community members believe this proposal will benefit the ICP ecosystem.

* The voting power of a neuron is computed as the product of the staked amount, the dissolve delay bonus and the age bonus. 
* The dissolve delay bonus historically has been a value between 1 and 2 and a linear function of the dissolve delay (which has a maximum value of eight years). The current minimum dissolve delay for making a neuron eligible for voting and receiving voting rewards is 6 months. 
* Currently, a neuron with a dissolve delay of 6 months has a dissolve delay bonus of 1.0625. A neuron with a dissolve delay of 8 years has a dissolve delay bonus of 2. 
For a detailed description of the Network Nervous System and the determination of voting power please refer to this article. 
* With a lower barrier to entry, we believe that more retail participants will be able to experience the entire workflow of staking ICP, casting votes and accruing voting rewards Our hypothesis is that the proposed change described in the next section will significantly increase the number of community members participating in the IC governance. We also believe that over time some of these community members will start committing to longer staking periods that offer larger voting rewards. 

# 3. Proposal

* To encourage additional users participating in the governance process we suggest that the minimum dissolve delay for voting should be set to 1 month instead of 6 months. 
* Given that we would like to keep the current incentive to stake for longer time periods greater than 6 months, the dissolve delay bonus between 0 and 6 months should be much lower compared to longer periods. As a simple solution we suggest that the dissolve delay bonus should be extended by a linear function with values between 0 and 1.0625 for the time between 0 and 6 months. From 6 months to 8 years the dissolve delay function should be unchanged The new function is illustrated in the following chart. 
* For a newly staked neuron, this would result in APYs depicted in the following chart. The values for 1 month are new (previously the APY was 0% as no rewards were given) and the values for 6 months and 8 years are unchanged. 


# 4. Impact and Assumptions

* The overall average APY would change from 15.72% to 15.46%.
* Approx 2m out of 116mn daily rewards (i.e. 1.7%) would be allocated to neurons with dissolve delay < 6 months. → The overall impact is relatively small.
* An additional 27mn (24mn dissolving, 3mn non-dissolving) of staked ICP becomes eligible for voting/rewards 
* This results in an additional voting power of 14mn. This is based on neuron data from the dashboard API, ignoring any age bonus (which would only affect the small porting of non-dissolving neurons).

# 5. Arguments for and against this change

* Community has discussed this proposal extensively in the original [forum post](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/proposal-reducing-minimum-staking-time-for-expanding-governance-participation/13586).
* Prominent Arguments which were against the proposal are answered [here](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/reducing-minimum-staking-time-for-expanding-governance-participation-next-steps/15164).

# 6. Alternatives considered 

* With respect to extending the function for the dissolve delay bonus to the time between 0 and 6 months, we also considered concave and convex alternatives. A concave (respectively convex) approach would provide higher (respectively lower) voting power and APY compared to the proposed linear function. Given that the precise choice turned out to be irrelevant for a 51% attack as outlined in the section Security, we concluded to use the simplest approach via a linear function. We also considered extending the same function but ruled it out as it will offer significant awards to people staking for very short duration such as 1 month which is counterintuitive.
* Alternative Proposal which reduces the minimum dissolve delay to pay voting rewards to 1 month AND increases the maximum dissolve delay bonus to 3.5 was considered. While we think it is not a fair argument (as discussed above), we feel that the new proposed 30 days dissolve delay completely eliminates this issue as well. We believe that the proposed change is not relevant. If an attacker has 51% of the voting power, then also the minimum dissolve delay can be adjusted. Thus an attacker would likely stake for 8 years (instead of staking for a shorter period) receive a dissolve delay bonus of 2 and then attempt to change the rules.

# 7. Conclusion

The presented proposal is our hypothesis on what could drive the maximum impact. Based on our discussions with various ICP holders, we found that there are several people that are sitting on the sidelines due to the 6 month minimum lockup requirement. We feel shortening the duration will enable them to get some real skin in the game when they start to see accrued rewards. Staking 1 ICP does not have the same impact as the accrued rewards are not that significant in value. The eventual goal is about giving people more flexibility to choose with a lower barrier to entry. 

# 8. What we are asking the community

* Review comments, ask questions, give feedback
* Vote accept or reject on NNS Motion

Proposal: Restrict Proposal Reward Qualification to a Threshold and enable UI changes on the NNS

Objectives

* Decrease incentives to submit spam governance proposals
* Protect the NNS from censorship, and preserve the current accessibility of submitting NNS governance proposals (i.e. does not increase the cost or difficulty of submitting an NNS proposal).
* Protect NNS voters from advertising or grief governance proposal spam

Note : In this post, all references to “proposal” refer to all proposals, those could be restricted to governance proposals, but I don’t think that is necessary.

Solution

* Update the NNS dApp to not show proposals that have not at least met the 1%(or modified) threshold of Accept votes required to pass unless a user chooses to unhide them.
* Update the NNS canister to skip rewarding proposals that have not received at least 1%(or modified) threshold of Accept votes.
* Update the NNS canister to extend the end date to match the initial voting period when the proposal passes the 1%(or modified) Accept vote proposal.
* Proposals that do not meet the Accept threshold will still have their ICP burned as a reject fee.

Implementation for Proposed Solution

** Note: The NNS dapp has been re-written since the original text was created so the NNS App line source has likely changed, but the concept translates directly to the new app.

After line 6027( https://github.com/dfinity/ic/blob/79bbd3177f6532037eb29d62b3e52a364a8103ee/rs/nns/governance/src/governance.rs#L6027 ) add the equivalent Rust code to the pseudocode below:

if( proposal.tally.yes/proposal.tally.total < MIN_NUMBER_VOTES_FOR_PROPOSAL_RATIO){continue;}

After line 5274(ic/governance.rs at 35acac6c1113a23e2cb92329f1431c5254567e6e · dfinity/ic · GitHub) add the equivalent Rust code to the pseudo code below:

let oldYesRatio = proposal.tally.yes / proposal.tally.total;

After line 5284(ic/governance.rs at 35acac6c1113a23e2cb92329f1431c5254567e6e · dfinity/ic · GitHub 1) add the equivalent Rust code to the pseudo code below:

If (proposal.tally.yes / proposal.tally.total >= 0.3 and oldYesRatio < 0.3){proposal. deadline_timestamp_seconds = deadline_timestamp_seconds + (now() - proposal.proposal_time_stamp_seonds);

After line 158(nns-dapp/Proposals.svelte at e9dd304d8aaa96f82e91936f23d1bf0c781ae9c5 · dfinity/nns-dapp · GitHub 1), wrap line 159 in:

{if proposalInfo.tally.yes/ [propsalInfo.tally.no](http://propsalInfo.tally.no) < ($UserConfiguredMinYesThreshold | 0.3)}

Line 159

{/if}

The NNS front app team will need to add a widget to allow for changing the UserConfiguredMinYesThreshold and storing the preferred value in webStorage.

How does this affect me as an NNS voter?

* Voters have no obligation to vote on a proposal(and will not miss out on rewards) until it reaches a 1% threshold of yes votes.
* Once the 1% yes threshold is reached, voters should vote or follow a voter to claim rewards(No change)

Why this proposal works

* NNS Participants only view and vote on spam proposals because they are required to. Not voting results in lost governance rewards, which are then directly split amongst those who do vote on the spam proposal. Introducing an incubation period and minimum support threshold removes the requirement to view and vote on each and every proposal that hits the NNS.
* Since NNS Voters are no longer required to vote for proposals that can’t meet the threshold, each proposal must reach the 1% yes minimum support threshold on its own merits and value proposition in order to receive attention from the whole community.
* This proposal does not increase the proposal creation or rejection cost, and therefore does not impose a greater financial burden on NNS Proposal Creators.
* Extending the time period at the point of crossing the 1% threshold keeps the consideration time the same.

Additional Benefits of this proposal

* Adding a minimum support threshold allows governance proposals to be visible on the NNS for a longer period of time, ensuring that less active NNS voters have the opportunity to vote for incubated proposals they support.
* Adding a minimum support threshold encourages NNS proposal creators to advertise, receive feedback, and iterate upon their proposals before submitting in order to ensure they will pass the 1% support threshold and proceed to a live vote on the NNS.

NNS App UI Changes

* Add a checkbox to allow power users to unhide the proposals that have not met the threshold.
* Make sure a proposer create can hotlink directly to a vote so they have something to use when they promote their proposal.(I think you can already do this…ie Internet Computer Content Validation Bootstrap 1, but if you are not authorized you lose your redirect…I think this is an easy fix)

Arguments Against/Potential Issues

1. This will not stop the current spammer from submitting NNS Proposals.

Rebuttal to (1) : Looking at one of the recent spam proposals by @ysyms, Internet Computer Network Status 1, we can see that only 0.2% of the total voting power is voting to accept these NNS proposals. This means that this would never be shown to most people, the vote would fail and the spammer would be charged their 10 ICP. It would not affect rewards

https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business4/uploads/dfn/original/2X/6/6a8bda0d0f2dca10c2e1da4185609693184e00df.png

Keep in mind that even for some of the spam NNS proposals that garnered more than 1% of the vote, many of these votes were novelty votes that were only cast because the item was visible. If the proposer had been forced to garner social momentum they likely would not have reached the threshold

2. It may be possible that more than 1% of the overall NNS voting power would be interested in advertising spam proposals for financial benefit.

Rebuttal to (2) : If more than 1% of the overall NNS voting power supports a spam attack, increasing the proposal cost would have little to no effect. The solution to this would be another proposal that further raises the minimum support threshold for governance proposals.

3. As an NNS Proposal submitter, I feel like this minimum support threshold places an additional financial burden on me to submit proposals to the NNS.

Rebuttal to (3) : The proposed solution does not change proposal submission costs for NNS creators. In fact, after this proposal goes live we could lower the proposal cost back to 1 ICP. If someone is submitting a proposal that they do not feel will receive the minimum support threshold by a voluntary vote, then they should advertise their proposal and timeline on the forums and social media (Twitter, DSCVR, Distrikt) to garner the necessary support before submitting a proposal to the NNS. If a proposal cannot reach 1% voluntary support, it’s unlikely that proposal will achieve a majority of voting power and pass when it goes live.

4. This is gatekeeping and keeps out NNS proposers that do not have popular support or a network with which to reach the 1% threshold.

Rebuttal to (4) : It is likely important to keep the threshold as low as possible such that it is still effective against spam. This proposal does increase the risk to un-networked proposers that they may lose their proposal stake without their proposal being considered. We would argue that this risk is not insurmountable and that any good faith proposal should be vetted with the community to an extent that it can garner at least the minimum before it is submitted. In short, this proposal does create a low hurdle, but one which is likely a net gain for everyone in the system. Given that time and resources are not unlimited forcing well-thought-out and minimally supported proposals makes governance possible as activity and interest increase.

Vote Accept to:

* Update the NNS dApp to not show proposals that have not at least met the 1%(or modified) threshold of Accept votes required to pass unless a user chooses to unhide them.
* Update the NNS canister to skip rewarding proposals that have not received at least 1%(or modified) threshold of Accept votes.
* Update the NNS canister to extend the end date to match the initial voting period when the proposal passes the 1%(or modified) Accept vote proposal.
* Proposals that do not meet the Accept threshold will still have their ICP burned as a reject fee.

## What is this?
This proposal is a functional test of the new front end form that makes it easy for anyone to publish NNS Proposals. If you are reading this, it means the test was successful!

The only way of making sure it worked was to use it to publish a real NNS Proposal. To support this project, please vote to adopt this proposal. Otherwise, I'll be charged a 10 ICP rejection fee.

## Background
A few weeks ago DFINITY put out a request for volunteers from the community to create more sample dapps. I reached out with the idea for creating a sample dapp which showed an example of how a canister could integrate with the NNS. They gave me the signal to move forward, and I decided to make a dapp that made creating NNS proposals easier and more accessible for non-technical users.

Right now creating an NNS proposal is a technical challenge, so it's only accessible to developers who are familiar with the CLI. For the NNS to be open, we need to be inclusive to non-technical members of the IC ecosystem.

## Next Steps
After a successful test of a governance motion proposal, I'll make another proposal to test the "register known neuron" proposal type. Then I'll be adding detailed documentation and submitting my work to DFINITY!

## What I Need From You
I would deeply appreciate it if you would vote to adopt this proposal, because otherwise I'll be charged a 10 ICP rejection fee. Since a functional test is the only way I can verify that my dapp works correctly and I'm making something for the benefit of the ecosystem, I don't think this proposal qualifies as spam. 

By voting to adopt this proposal, you are showing your support for this project, which is focused on making NNS proposal submissions more accessible for everyone.

## 1. Who I am
I'm an early adopter.

## 2. Objective
I am testing this dApp to see if it works.  So far so good.

## 3. Background
I've submitted proposals before and agree there is a high technical hurdle.  

## 4. Why this is important
To prove to everyone that it really works.

## 5. Pros
This dApp gives everyone in the NNS a voice.  It even gives everyone who isn't in the NNS a voice.  It's super cheap to submit a proposal and now it is easy.

## 6. Cons
This dApp gives everyone in the NNS a voice.  It even gives everyone who isn't in the NNS a voice.  It's super cheap to submit a proposal and now it is easy.

## 7. Key milestones (if any)
Visit website - check

Copy deposit address - check


Transfer 10 ICP - check


Check balance - check


Fill out the form - check


Submit proposal - let's see...

## 8. Discussion leads (if any)
Me

## 9. Security concerns (if any)
Cheap, easy, and anonymous spam

## 10. What we are asking the community
If this proposal makes it to the NNS, then the dApp works and I would appreciate if you will vote YES so the developer can keep the 10 ICP that I paid to submit this proposal.  It's the least we can do to show him thanks for enabling all of us to easily voice our opinions through the NNS.

## Postface
Hey Isaac, the app seems to want a URL, but that is not a requirement to submit a motion proposal.  I will try to bypass it by simply entering double quotes, but you might want to do that with your code if the field is empty.  Also, I recommend you remove the disclaimer and your website address from the proposal title.  Neither of those seem necessary, especially if your goal is to empower the people to speak with their own voice through the NNS.  That information is distracting at the top of the proposal.  It seems you could advertise by tacking on an appendix with reduced content and get the intended messages across.

Just stop it            # Replace nodes in subnet k44fs

Motivation: replacing 1 unhealthy node; replacing 2 nodes to improve subnet decentralization  Removing OR1 nodes from the registry in accordance with https://forum.dfinity.org/t/the-state-and-direction-of-decentralization-nodes-on-the-internet-computer/9170/105                     Set rewards for the following nodes:
* hy7f5-pw2f5-6qinp-znpu5-6gb25-xmbg2-vunun-uzcuk-fodvd-lwg4m-mqe

The node has been running in the pjljw subnet since May.
                    # Hello! My name is Isaac Valadez.
I'm 31 years old and live in Houston with my wife and two daughters.

## Why I want a named neuron
As of last week, I've finally transitioned to working on the IC full-time! I'd like to have a named neuron for these reasons:
1. I need to submit this proposal to make sure the "Register Known Neuron" feature on [nnsproposal.icp.xyz](https://nnsproposal.icp.xyz/) works properly.
2. I'm working on some exciting projects that'll be impacted by the NNS, so I'd like to give others a way to support these projects by following my neuron.

In fact, I'll be publishing a whitepaper on a new type of DAO model soon on [Medium](https://medium.com/@Isaac.Valadez) and [Nuance](https://exwqn-uaaaa-aaaaf-qaeaa-cai.ic0.app/isaac). You can find my other social media URLs at [isaac.icp.page](https://isaac.icp.page/), but be sure to [follow me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/IsaacValadez55) if you want to stay in the loop with this.

## My contributions to the IC ecosystem
- Right after Genesis, I was the first one to figure out how to make a contact form with automatic email notifications work in the IC.
- I created the concept for [dSquad](https://twitter.com/dSquadNFT) and ran the project as CEO up until handing it over to the owner on September 2022. I lead this project through a successful presale and my pitch helped it win 1st place in Metaverse & NFT during the Supernova Hackathon.
- I created the dapp used to submit this NNS proposal as an open community tool ([nnsproposal.icp.xyz](https://nnsproposal.icp.xyz/)).

## How I will vote
My neuron is optimized for maximizing rewards and it follows DFINITY, Internet Computer Association, ICDevs.org, Synapse.vote, and a few other individuals.

However, I will be taking a special interest and manually voting on most governance topics. These are some of my values regarding Web3 governance:
- It should be accessible, fair, permissionless, and transparent.
- We need to think about how we can add accountability to Web3 governance decisions.
- We should be very careful to avoid catering only to those who are rich/influential because power naturally tends to centralize.
- Topics like the socialism vs capitalism debate are worn out and too polarizing to be productive, so we need to focus on exploring effective new ideas, avoiding political terms and language which distract and divide. We need to move conversations like this forward, rather than getting stuck debating which 100-year-old framework for over-generalizing complex decisions is worse.
- I want to protect the ability (and responsibility) of the NNS to fully control and even censor the network because 100% immutability of harmful dapps could be nearly as bad as censorship in the wrong hands. Instead, we need to make the NNS the right tool for resolving sensitive decisions like whether or not something needs to be censored.
- I want to make sure we don't get the NNS into trouble with regulators because even if the NNS can get away with something, it should still be a good "world citizen" and be careful not to act recklessly.
- We need to find a way to implement some type of quadratic voting mechanism as soon as we can find an effective approach for doing so.
- If a few years from now the NNS is still easily controlled by a small group of elites or "experts", we've failed.
- Ideally, in the future, the NNS will be diversified by many large neurons controlled by DAOs with various different DAO structures. This means the NNS will become more of an L1 governance system, decentralized by the diversity of both the participants with neurons and the different governance models controlling how those neurons make decisions.

## More About Me
I'm not sure what to call myself other than a generalized nerd who likes to make things.


I've been a business owner, product manager, inventor, corporate B2B sales rep, mechanical engineer, digital marketer, & web developer. What might seem like a random background has always been driven by a strong desire to understand and master all the different skills required to successfully build products/services that deliver value to others.


In addition, I love the study of physics, have a Mechanical Engineering degree, and enjoy 3D printing as a hobby.


Whatever I might do professionally, nothing will ever surpass the incredible accomplishment of my happy marriage to my best friend and the joy of parenting my two beautiful young daughters.

## Next Step
Thank you so much for your time reading this, please vote to adopt this proposal so that I can register my known neuron!

Sincerely,

*-Isaac*

# Correction to proposal [#85719](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/85719)!
There was a bug in my dapp which caused my first "Register Known Neuron" attempt to have an incorrect Neuron ID.
- ## Please reject proposal 85719.
- ## Please vote to adopt this proposal instead.

As soon as I publish this proposal and verify that the bug is fixed, I'll enable the "Register Known Neuron" feature for others to use.

You can find my other social media URLs at [isaac.icp.page](https://isaac.icp.page/), but be sure to [follow me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/IsaacValadez55) if you want to stay in the loop with this.

## My contributions to the IC ecosystem
- Right after Genesis, I was the first one to figure out how to make a contact form with automatic email notifications work in the IC.
- I created the concept for [dSquad](https://twitter.com/dSquadNFT) and ran the project as CEO up until handing it over to the owner on September 2022. I lead this project through a successful presale and my pitch helped it win 1st place in Metaverse & NFT during the Supernova Hackathon.
- I created the dapp used to submit this NNS proposal as an open community tool ([nnsproposal.icp.xyz](https://nnsproposal.icp.xyz/)).

## How I will vote
My neuron is optimized for maximizing rewards and it follows DFINITY, Internet Computer Association, ICDevs.org, Synapse.vote, and a few other individuals.

However, I will be taking a special interest and manually voting on most governance topics. These are some of my values regarding Web3 governance:
- It should be accessible, fair, permissionless, and transparent.
- We need to think about how we can add accountability to Web3 governance decisions.
- We should be very careful to avoid catering only to those who are rich/influential because power naturally tends to centralize.
- Topics like the socialism vs capitalism debate are worn out and too polarizing to be productive, so we need to focus on exploring effective new ideas, avoiding political terms and language which distract and divide. We need to move conversations like this forward, rather than getting stuck debating which 100-year-old framework for over-generalizing complex decisions is worse.
- I want to protect the ability (and responsibility) of the NNS to fully control and even censor the network because 100% immutability of harmful dapps could be nearly as bad as censorship in the wrong hands. Instead, we need to make the NNS the right tool for resolving sensitive decisions like whether or not something needs to be censored.
- I want to make sure we don't get the NNS into trouble with regulators because even if the NNS can get away with something, it should still be a good "world citizen" and be careful not to act recklessly.
- We need to find a way to implement some type of quadratic voting mechanism as soon as we can find an effective approach for doing so.
- If a few years from now the NNS is still easily controlled by a small group of elites or "experts", we've failed.
- Ideally, in the future, the NNS will be diversified by many large neurons controlled by DAOs with various different DAO structures. This means the NNS will become more of an L1 governance system, decentralized by the diversity of both the participants with neurons and the different governance models controlling how those neurons make decisions.

## More About Me
I'm not sure what to call myself other than a generalized nerd who likes to make things.


I've been a business owner, product manager, inventor, corporate B2B sales rep, mechanical engineer, digital marketer, & web developer. What might seem like a random background has always been driven by a strong desire to understand and master all the different skills required to successfully build products/services that deliver value to others.


In addition, I love the study of physics, have a Mechanical Engineering degree, and enjoy 3D printing as a hobby.


Whatever I might do professionally, nothing will ever surpass the incredible accomplishment of my happy marriage to my best friend and the joy of parenting my two beautiful young daughters.

## Next Step
Thank you so much for your time reading this, please vote to adopt this proposal so that I can register my known neuron!

Sincerely,
-Isaac

       I want to motivate other voting neurons to register themselves as known neurons, because from now on it isn't open only to programmers who can do it, but to all other people known more or less in the open community on a global scale.

## Goal
As a community, we need more named neurons to increase decentralization. So I want to create a neuron that will inspire ordinary people to propose NNS and name their neuron via the nnsproposal.icp.xyz website.

## Why should you approve this proposal?
It's quite simple, you support the decentralization of the protocol in this way. I would be just another named neuron on the list, and I hope to inspire other people to create their own named neurons. Everyone should be able to be a named neuron. It should be decentralized.

## How will I vote?
I will be voting manually approximately once every 24 hours. I have a lot of time to be a full-fledged neuron voting for all those who relate their future to the NNS, the IC Protocol and a large part of their capital. I manually vote all other proposals if the neurons I am currently tracking have not done so (I will vote on each proposal no later than 24 hours after the proposal was made).

## What do I consider necessary?
I want to be sure that long-term investors (without delimiting how much capital we are talking about) will be satisfied with observing my neuron by voting on every possible proposal without having to waste time every day checking whether they are sure to vote for all of them and that the votes will be in line with the long-term development of ICP in a decentralized yet efficient and scalable network of subnets.

"Let's recreate the internet by voting together."

## Who am I anyway?
A Music Producer and ICP Investor from the very beginning.

                                             ## Objective
The increasingly implemented SNS is a prelude to the launch of the Community Fund. This requires all of us to be involved in a joint commitment to ensure that the projects that receive financial support from the NNS are of the best quality.

## When writing quality, what do I really mean?
The point isn't to waste the maturity of the neurons involved in decentralized sales on project tokens that look suspicious, uncertain or not at all related to the idea of ​​a decentralized web3. From the observations of many dapps, I came to the conclusion that you can come across both well and poorly implemented projects.
The good ones usually work until now. We can hear about them in the media and, looking at the market capitalization, come to the conclusion that all of them when added together exceed the value of the very ecosystem they are based on.
The bad ones that weren't lucky enough to be successful are quite common, in my opinion:
* Highly centralized.
* They require a lot of trust from the creator to be fully functional.
* They aren't often fully related to cryptocurrencies.
* About closed source.
* Vulnerable to attacks by people with bad intentions.
* Being a book example of a Ponzi scheme.

And many others...

## Why do I want to become a called neuron?
Because the goal of the currently known neurons isn't to focus fully on the analysis of projects seeking funding from the Community Fund (which will soon be crucial for the further development of the ecosystem along with the tokenomy), but rather to decentralize the NNS. Participants need a wide range of known neurons in order to select the most appropriate one for each proposal category. Each of the neurons should specialize only in certain predetermined topics for decisions to be fully thought through by experts in the field. I wouldn't like to disclose anyone's knowledge on this subject, but simply focus 100% of my attention on responsible voting on the thematically related proposals directly related to the Community Fund.
Bearing in mind that I risk the resources not only of my own, but of my followers - it's already there, but it will become an even more important and responsible task for me if you decide to accept me on the list of Known Neurons.

## Who I am?
My professional experience is work and pleasure in one. I'm a 23 years old e-sports player. I devote a lot of time to the games themselves, side by side developing my experience and knowledge in the field of cyber security.

## How I vote?
I cast my vote on the basis of a thorough analysis of individual web3 projects. It is subjective because I risk my own stake. You can count on my several years of experience in the gaming industry, which certainly helps in assessing each one on the basis of its mechanics, tokenomy and whether it's a good place for your maturity and profit potential.

## Warnings
* You follow my movements only at your own risk.
* Before observing my neuron, check that the decisions I make are fully in line with your expectations.
* I vote for proposals for Community Fund investments based on my knowledge, experience and in-depth, primarily my subjective analysis.
* Follow me only on topics related directly to the Community Fund (for everyone else I vote according to the will of the majority. When it comes to governance, I'm following the DFINITY Foundation).
* In case of uncertainty as to voting for (or against) taking up the investment - I will cast the deciding vote in the hands of the Internet Computer Association.

This proposal is not intended to represent any concrete ideas.  It serves to gauge interest from the voters about whether the NNS should independently own and control an ICP treasury.  Specific details around purpose, funding mechanisms, and fund distribution would be developed in working groups and approved by the NNS at a future date.

We are asking you to vote to approve this proposal if you support further exploration of the NNS Treasury idea.  Vote no if you believe the NNS Treasury idea should not be considered further.

                            ## 1. Who I am

The person behind Always Rejects wishes to stay anonymous. You can find the rationale behind this neuron on the forum:

https://forum.dfinity.org/t/named-neuron-proposal-always-votes/14992/42

as well as in this FAQ I made:

https://alwaysvotes.xyz/

## 2. Objective

To provide people with a neuron to follow on motion proposals when they:

- don't have time to monitor all these proposals and forum threads themselves.
- don't trust current named neurons or they don't think the current followable neurons represent their values/interests.
- don't want to lose out on voting rewards. 

-----

Originally this neuron also meant to serve the purpose of a protest vote by letting people auto reject non motion proposals. 

However for this usecase I really want the neuron to fully run on the Internet Computer since a hack could have dangerous consequences. 

This is too much time and effort at the moment so I removed this purpose from the FAQ at alwaysvotes.xyz. I can't edit the forum post anymore. 

I think it should still be fine if you a relatively minuscule amount of voting power as these proposals pass with 99.99% but don't follow me here if you have a large following. 

This neuron also originally had the purpose to offer a way for people to default reject unless they want to vote Accept manually themselves. 

I decided in the end that I would rather have the automation run every couple hours so that if something goes wrong I still have days to make sure the neuron votes on everything.

-----

The reason I'm coming forth with this named neuron proposal now is because of the recent developments on the forum and twitter around what to do with neuron voting rewards. 

I think the speed at which these things go through is bananas. I really can't take the NNS seriously until we have a process similar to the Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIP). 

Until that is the case I hope this neuron is able to slow things down a bit. I am NOT against the IC and the NNS in general. I just think it should be the final step after a longer off chain process. 

Will post proof to the forum post and twitter that this is me. You can also see the neuron ID on my website.

                                             ## 1. Who I am
My name is Smaug. I am a retail investor who would like the internet computer to succeed. I have an MA in Economics, and can be said to be a master of the subject.

## 2. Objective

After seeing some people make ludicrous suggestions, saying things like “we should unlock all seed investors neurons right now”, as an MA economist I have a counter proposal:

All seed investors’ neurons which have not yet unlocked should be automatically staked for 8 years.

This would stop the monthly dumps of several millions of ICP. Rewards would remain on their current schedule. This would stop or significantly slow the outward shift of the supply curve, which might be enough to cause price to stop falling.

Please note that even if the demand curve does not change but the supply curve continues to shift outward, price will fall. I believe investors are hesitant to increase investment into ICP in part because of the periodic unlocking of new tokens.

With the outward shift in the supply curve arrested, investors would show confidence in the future of ICP. New money would flow into the token, shifting the demand curve outward and allowing price to increase.

Suggesting that we should simply unlock all tokens now and end the period of unlocks thusly is incredibly short-sighted. With over 100 million ICP suddenly unlocked, this shock could be enough to kill the coin and the project. Who would continue to invest? But with unlocks halted as I suggest, investors would feel more comfortable. Developers would come, as the fear of monthly dumps would be far removed.

With more investment and development we would enter a cycle of positive reinforcement, where the adjusted tokenomics would lead to further development and investment.

I am not a developer. I am merely a master of economics. Somebody else will need to create the proposal with the capability to enact these popular demands.

Thank you. I look forward to the discussion

## 3. Background
ICP has dumped from over $700 (is that all?) to below $5. Perhaps it has to do with seed investors selling their ICP the moment they get the ability to do so.

## 4. Why this is important
I want to arrest this persistent price decline.

## 5. Pros
This will greatly decrease the newly unlocking supply each month. Supply being stabilized, investors will be able to reconsider whether to bring their new money into this ecosystem.

## 6. Cons
The richest of ICP holders will not be able to destroy this token as quickly.

## 7. Key milestones (if any)
A following proposal must be enacted with the code/capability of forcefully increasing the dissolve delay of these neurons and changing their status to non-dissolving.

## 8. Discussion leads (if any)
Alice, Bob, etc...

## 9. Security concerns (if any)
None.

## 10. What we are asking the community

Pass this proposal to lock the neurons of wealthy seed investors. These investors like to sell their ICP as soon as it unlocks.

               ## 1. Who I am
Hello, I go by Nihilor on all platforms, my name is Ben. I am a father of 6 and have been in crypto since the ETH ICO days.

## 2. Objective
My purpose behind this proposal is to address the euphoria over token minting/tokenomics changes that seems to be taking hold in our community.

## 3. Background
 I realize it can be painful when the price seems to keep going down and that a few tweaks to tokenomics might seem to be a magic bullet that will solve all your problems. It is rarely that simple, but I believe simply having these conversations and subsequent proposals will cause investors and developers to think twice about using our platform. We must be ethical, responsible, and equitable in our use of the NNS.

## 4. Why this is important
I believe that unrestrained DAO’s are a recipe for chaos and destruction. I want to see ICP succeed, and to this end I propose we make a few tweaks to how we operate, perhaps the equivalent of of a constitution or laws that we agree to be bound by. This is necessary, in my opinion, because at this rate I cant imagine anyone would put millions of dollars at risk in this ecosystem without minimal guarantees for restricted operation of the all powerful NNS. Below are the changes I propose to secure our platform and provide faith in our governance.

## 5. Pros
-Investor Confidence

-Developer confidence

## 6. Cons
-More difficult to mint and spend ICP

-More difficult to change tokenomics

## 7. Key milestones (if any)
N/A

## 8. Discussion leads (if any)
Ben (Nihilor)

## 9. Security concerns (if any)

N/A
## 10. What we are asking the community
-Inflation is capped - Outside of normal operation the NNS can not simply mint ICP. If the NNS decides to make an expenditure, it will be subtracted from maturity across all neurons until the debt is fully paid. “Printing” money should never feel free or easy, we need to be frugal and responsible stewards of the tokens we control. This will include any future treasury.

-Tokenomics changes require a 75% supermajority vote - If we decide to change any part of our tokenomics such as: node rewards, staking rewards, burn rate, forcibly changing neuron dissolve delay, and transaction fees. A supermajority vote will be required of no less than 75% (yes) of all votes cast.

I believe these two changes are needed and will begin to form a foundation of trust in the NNS which is needed for long term health and growth.

# Background & Problem statement

Canisters have two types of methods: updates and queries. In contrast to updates, queries are not composable. In other words, a query cannot call other queries. This limitation makes it difficult to build scalable dapps that shard data across multiple canisters. Supporting calls in query methods is one of the most requested features.

We have an experimental prototype implementation of the feature. The prototype has two limitations:

1. it does not support cross-subnet calls, which means that a query can only call queries of other canisters that are on the same subnet as the original canister.
2. it does not support replicated execution, which means that a query is executed on a single machine of a subnet and its result doesn’t go through consensus.

Implementing the missing parts is a large (1-2 years) engineering effort due to technical challenges outlined in [this forum post](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/inter-canister-query-calls-community-consideration/6754/84).

# Proposal

Our proposal is to release the prototype with the known limitations and postpone the full implementation to the future.

We expect the following work before the prototype can be released:

* Add a new query type for backwards compatibility.
* Implement protection against malicious canisters.
* Improve performance.
* Write the specification.

We need a new query type because the existing queries can be executed both in non-replicated and replicated mode. Since the prototype doesn’t support replicated execution, releasing it without a new query type would break the contract of the existing queries.

We propose to name the new query type "composite_query" and propose the following changes:

* Add a new public entry-point type in the WebAssembly module of canisters: "canister_composite_query method_name".
* Add a new "composite_query" keyword in Motoko, Rust CDK, and Candid.

Composite queries will be similar to the existing regular queries except that they can call other queries and they do not support replicated execution. Note that composite queries can call both regular and composite queries. Update methods cannot call composite queries.

# Future outlook

In the future it should be possible to implement support for both cross-subnet calls and replicated execution.

For cross-subnet calls we would need to solve the technical challenge related to the security of "caller_id" ([details](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/inter-canister-query-calls-community-consideration/6754/53#explanation-of-trade-off-2-6)) and rewrite the existing implementation of query calls to use an asynchronous/distributed algorithm.

Replicated execution support has more complexity and unknowns. Core components of the Internet Computer such as state manager, message routing, execution would need to support multiple versions of the same canister in the replicated state.

If both features are implemented, we would be able to unify composite queries and regular queries.

# Alternatives

We could attempt to avoid a new query type by implementing support for replicated execution before releasing the feature. We expect this to be a significant engineering effort that would delay the feature by at least 1-2 years.

                   ## 1. Who I am

I am Nicolas. My idea last year was to do an unlimited bike trip and promote the Internet Computer. 
This event was postponed due to bear market and personal reasons but %Spoiler% I give myself 2 years to prepare everything and will definitely make this happen.

https://twitter.com/ICbicycle

## 2. Objective

I would like to create a neuron to allow people that share my ideas to follow it. It prettier than a number and it will a bit show that I am involved.

It would also help decentralized voter distribution around neurons and flatten the voting curve.


## 3. Background

Bachelor in IT, Master in international Business I speak 5 languages and do a lot of sport. I work in CH. Bought most of my ICP at 100 Dollars if you would like to know.

## 4. Why this is important

It is not that important, but this way people could easily see what I officially voted for and make me accountable.

## 5. Pros

See section 1. 2. 4. and I am very transparent.


## 6. Cons

I am direct and do not fear being ridiculous ( is honesty a Cons ? )

## 7. Key milestones 

1. Coded my first website with Hugo few years ago
2. Would like to make the Web3 of it in the ICP
3. Share my trip adventure on it and on ICP network with some ICP information/update/review/talks 

## 8. Discussion leads 

I hate proposals that are sent without a propers SWAT chart.

## 9. Security concerns (if any)

See section 8. and the habits of some to change every month token-economics. I will be in favour of those change only if It flawless and reasonable for all ecosystem ( investors are just a part of it)

## 10. What we are asking the community

* Be kind, Review comments, ask questions, give feedback

* Vote accept or reject on Known Neuron Registration

                      ## Who we are?
CF Ventures concentrates its investment in software and information products. It focuses mainly on business clients.

CF Ventures has successfully started many business ventures from the idea stage. Therefore, it can invest at the startup stage. However, investments are preferred at the later stage of business development.

CF Ventures is confident in the future value of the information products and services and sees no sign in the economy that the future growth in these activities will be diminished.

## Investment Objective
The objective of CF Ventures is to make equity investments primarily in later–stage projects as well as to provide equity financing for acquisitions and recapitalizations.

## Why we apply for the named neuron?
As a smaller fund / investor in IC, it's certainly great if we can be called a neuron. Each of us should be able to express our point of view, but not everyone can use their voice to speak out loud to the entire community, being followed by fans.
So we apply for a named neuron and we will gladly introduce our investors, and we will consider further investments in projects on the IC chain.

## How we vote? What we offer?
We will vote from the investors' point of view to vote for as many proposals as possible on behalf of all ICP token holders, in order to try to pro-increase the token price.
We propose to focus on priorities, not trivia. Let's develop the ecosystem to attract capital from other ecosystems, such as Ethereum. Let us work towards decentralizing the protocol, which is important for members of the community and for our clients to be profitable in the long term. This is the main tenet of our fund, which will require us to collect our opinion and the voice of the public on a frequent basis. We have the tools and the ability to conduct research trials in the wider community.

## Conclusion
We ask all NNS neurons to vote that we will be called a neuron. We will try to defend the value of the IC network to our customers and the decentralization of power over it to our followers. Our employees entitled to vote through this neuron will constantly work on creating valuable proposals for implementing innovations, as well as voting on proposals on behalf of investors with the common good of the entire community in mind.

                                      1. What is ICPstakingNFT :
This NFT is a simple idea of helping people to get SNS tokens without being locked in the NNS for 8 years. 
I anticipate the Community Fund as best Launchpad for SNS Tokens on IC. 
ICPstakingNFT is the receipt of ownership for ICP staked in Network Nervous System (NNS) Community Fund with 8 years dissolve delay. All ICP collected are staked in NNS Neuron 3254539716254637392
Utility of NFT is the option to transfer ownership for ICP staked, with NO locking period
Future plans for this NFT is to became  DAO(Decentralised Autonomous Organisation) - NFT owners will have full control over the project by voting. The holders of the NFTs are the owner of the ICPstakingNFT project.
Because NFT’s are not liquid all the time on the market, we create Redeem Liquidity Fund(redeemliquidityfund.icp). 
10% from rewards are redirected to Redeem Liquidity Fund for NFT owners to have chance to redeem NFT at last minting price. 

Redeem Liquidity Fund(redeemliquidityfund.icp) is an important part of ICPstakingNFT because:
- Collecting liquidity to redeem NFT at the same minting price, when there is no liquidity on Marketplace,
- Swiping the NFT Marketplace floor to avoid NFT price dropping under actual value,
- Redeemed NFT re-selling on the marketplace to increase liquidity 
- liquidity of redeemliquidityfund.icp wallet is transparent 

https://linktr.ee/icpstakingnft

2. Objective
I would like to register my neuron as a named neuron. This neuron will be active in issues of governance and will attempt to represent the interests of NFT holders. 
3. Why this is important
NFT is to became a BIG DAO(Decentralised Autonomous Organisation) NFT owners will have full control over the project by voting. The holders of the NFTs are the owner of the ICPstakingNFT project.
4. Key milestones (if any)

# Summary

Heartbeat is a mechanism for canisters to perform periodic tasks on the Internet Computer. If a canister exports the `canister_heartbeat` WASM method, then this method will be invoked in roughly every round (the actual schedule depends on the subnet load).

The main drawback of the existing heartbeat design is that it is impossible to configure the frequency or disable the heartbeat. This "all or nothing" design wastes resources and cycles.

The goal of this proposal is to provide a way to run any number of periodic tasks with configurable frequency using a high-level timer library implemented in Motoko and Rust. The design has been proposed and discussed on the forum: https://forum.dfinity.org/t/heartbeat-improvements-timers-community-consideration/14201

# Proposed Design

We propose to add a global timer functionality to the Internet Computer. This timer will be separate from the existing heartbeat functionality, which will continue to be supported, but canisters can easily migrate to use the more flexible timer instead of the existing heartbeat.

# Proposed changes in the Internet Computer

1. Add a new System API `ic0.global_timer_set(time: i64) -> i64` function.
2. The function schedules a call to the exported "canister_global_timer" Wasm method in some round after the specified time.
3. The function returns the previous value of the timer.

# Proposed changes in Motoko/Rust CDK

Add a timer library with the following interface:

1. `timer_id = set_timer(delay, fun)` – one-off execution of the fun after a minimum delay in seconds.
2. `timer_id = set_timer_interval(delay, fun)` – periodic execution of the fun with a minimum delay in seconds.
3. `clear_timer(timer_id)` – clear the previously set one-off or periodic timer_id.

Note: the API is in pseudocode, and will be adapted to the Motoko/Rust style.

# Implementation Details

1. The "canister_global_timer" will be called with the `Heartbeat` SystemAPI type, so the same restrictions apply as for the heartbeats.

2. The timer will be canceled during the upgrade, so the canister is expected to serialize the state of its timers and later restore it and set the timers in the "canister_post_upgrade".

# Alternatives

A few alternatives were considered:

1. Heartbeat interval: allows canisters to change their heartbeat interval run time. Conceptually very similar solution to timers, but might be confusing for the existing users of the heartbeats.
2. Multiple timers: the IC is to provide an interface similar to JS setTimeout/setInterval. A complete solution for Rust, but seems like much more work for Motoko team.
3. Call-based timers: canisters call a management canister and receive a reject after a delay. The timers might be awaitable like normal calls, but the pending calls prevent canisters from being upgraded until there are no more pending timers.

# Key Teams Involved

Runtime, Language and SDK teams will be involved in this implementation.

   # Replace a node in subnet snjp4

Motivation: Replacing an unhealthy node                                                                                       # Internet Identity Subnet Migration: Upgrade Internet Identity to Migration Version (Hard Locked)

This proposal is part of the Internet Identity subnet migration. Visit [the forum](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/internet-identity-subnet-migration-on-october-26/15989) for more information.

This proposal upgrades Internet Identity to release [release-2022-10-21_migration_hard_locked](https://github.com/dfinity/internet-identity/releases/tag/release-2022-10-21_migration_hard_locked) at commit [13dc4fa44f30dd9370ec9e0947b993f9a9462824](https://github.com/dfinity/internet-identity/commit/13dc4fa44f30dd9370ec9e0947b993f9a9462824).

This release disables all stable memory write access to Internet Identity to prevent changes during the migration. Deploying this release ensures that there is a clearly defined state to restore in case of a rollback.

# Wasm-Native Stable Memory

## Objective
The goal of introducing Wasm-native stable memory is to improve the
performance of stable reads and writes by letting these operations
directly access stable memory in the same way Wasm loads and stores
currently access the Wasm heap. This will make direct use of stable
memory more practical and it will not require canister developers to
make any changes to how they use stable memory.

## Background

### What is Stable Memory?
Stable memory is an array of bytes that canisters can use and is
persisted across canister upgrades. Canisters with smaller amounts of
data can use stable memory to persist data across updates by
serializing objects from the Wasm heap into stable memory before an
update and deserializing it back to the Wasm heap after the update.
But larger canisters may permanently keep their data in stable memory
and only move pieces of it to the Wasm heap when needed.

Stable memory is accessed through the `stable64_read` and
`stable64_write` [system API
calls](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/references/ic-interface-spec/#system-api-stable-memory)
which copy a slice of data between stable memory and the Wasm heap.

### Why is Stable Memory slower than the Wasm Heap?

The stable memory system API functions are currently implemented by
Rust code which is registered with the Wasmtime engine when it
executes a message in a canister. This means that each read/write to
stable memory requires the canister to call into the Wasmtime engine,
which then executes the Rust function to handle the read/write. On
the other hand, when a canister performs a read/write
to the Wasm heap, the Wasmtime engine knows where the Wasm heap
resides in RAM so it can compile the canister’s Wasm instructions into
a single assembly `load` or `store` instruction.

This proposal will make the performance of stable memory accesses
closer to the performance of Wasm heap accesses.

## Benefits

One current disadvantage of storing canister data directly in stable
memory is that accessing it can be significantly slower than accessing
the Wasm heap. This feature would significantly improve the
performance of stable reads and writes (likely by 2x or more for
certain workloads) to bring them closer to the performance of Wasm
heap reads and writes [1]. This would make it easier for canisters to
store the majority of their data directly in stable memory and keep
the Wasm heap for "scratch space". This pattern has several
advantages:

1. Canisters can store more data: Stable memory can currently hold up
to 32 GiB as opposed to 4 GiB for the Wasm heap.
2. Upgrades are faster: Upgrading no longer requires serializing and
deserializing the entire Wasm heap.
3. Upgrades are safer: Removing the (de)serializing steps can make
upgrade code simpler which decreases the likelihood of bugs or hitting
message instruction limits.

Furthermore, introducing the ability for canisters to use multiple
memories opens doors for several possible future improvements in the
area of BigData:
1. Canisters may eventually be able to have several different memories
with different properties (e.g. many small memories that are just as
fast as the wasm heap, or memories with different lifetimes).
2. Tracking memory accesses could be done within the canister itself
(in an additional memory) which would be faster than our current
segfault handler implementation.
3. We could introduce the ability for additional memories to be passed
between canisters.

## Proposal

Wasm-native stable memory would use the Wasm
[multi-memory](https://github.com/WebAssembly/multi-memory/blob/master/proposals/multi-memory/Overview.md)
and [memory64](https://github.com/WebAssembly/memory64/blob/main/proposals/memory64/Overview.md)
features to define a second 64-bit memory which the canister can
directly access. By "directly access" we mean that
stable API calls will be converted to Wasm `memory.copy` instructions
which Wasmtime can compile to standard assembly load/stores. This will
be much faster than the layers of function calls currently needed to
go through the Wasmtime engine. In particular, the main changes to be
made are:

1. Enable the multi-memory and memory64 features in Wasmtime and
implement those features in our Wasm parser and code generator.
2. Modify canister instrumentation to inject the second 64-bit memory
for stable memory and replace stable memory API calls with the
corresponding `memory.copy` instructions.
3. Modify the existing segfault signal handler to be aware that there
are now two memories each canister will be directly accessing and
properly handle the two cases.
Note that canisters will not directly use the multi-memory or memory64
features - they will only be used through code that is inserted during
the instrumentation step. But it may happen that a later proposal
offers a way to give canisters direct access to these features.

## Risks

The Wasm multi-memory feature is not yet standardized and has not yet
been implemented in most Wasm engines. This means that we may waste
engineering time if modifications are made to the spec while it is
being standardized. It is also possible that the multi-memory feature
is ultimately rejected, in which case this proposal would need to be
rolled back. But that wouldn’t break any canisters because canisters
will not directly use the multi-memory feature.

The memory64 feature is also not standardized, but it has already been
implemented in Chrome and Firefox so it is likely to be standardized
without any changes.

The `parity-wasm` library which we use for parsing and generating Wasm
code does not yet have support for memory64 and multi-memory Wasm.
This means we may need to maintain a fork if our implementation of the
features isn’t accepted upstream.

## What are we asking the community

- Vote accept or reject on NNS Motion
- Participate in technical discussions as the motion moves forward

## Footnotes

[1] Stable reads/writes would still not be quite as fast as Wasm heap
reads/writes because the Wasm heap only has 32-bits of addressable
memory which allows Wasmtime to do some [neat
tricks](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/blob/32a7593c949a17f20c2a718e1cbf0d8c449b0c47/cranelift/wasm/src/code_translator.rs#L2246)
to avoid checking that the memory accesses are in-bounds. The stable
memory would need to use 64-bit addresses to allow it to grow beyond
4GiB and that means Wasmtime needs to insert a bounds check before
each access.

## Summary
This is part of a series of proposals to add all the SNS canister binaries to SNS-WASM to enable deploying SNS instances. This proposal adds an SNS Governance binary to SNS-WASM. 

An SNS instance is a collection of many SNS canisters: Governance, Ledger, Root, etc. The NNS canister SNS-WASM is a repository of these SNS canister binaries, but currently does not have these SNS binaries because it was just deployed. Once a binary for each SNS canister type is added to SNS-WASM (via proposals like this one), SNSes can be deployed via SNS-WASM's deploy_new_sns method (although access to this method is currently restricted in order to validate SNS deployments in a controlled manner).

# Release Notes:
* Expand stable storage and update bitcoin config.

Configures the routing of the bitcoin mainnet canister and expands the stable storage to 48GiB, which are prerequisites for the upcoming bitcoin launch. This build will be deployed only to the bitcoin subnet `w4rem`, to help the bitcoin team stay on track with development pace, but these changes will also be rolled out to the remaining subnets in the following release cycle.
